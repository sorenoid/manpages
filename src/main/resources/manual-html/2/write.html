<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">write - write
to a file descriptor</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ssize_t
write(int</b> <i>fd</i><b>, const void *</b><i>buf</i><b>,
size_t</b> <i>count</i><b>);</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>write</b>()
writes up to <i>count</i> bytes from the buffer starting at
<i>buf</i> to the file referred to by the file descriptor
<i>fd</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The number of
bytes written may be less than <i>count</i> if, for example,
there is insufficient space on the underlying physical
medium, or the <b>RLIMIT_FSIZE</b> resource limit is
encountered (see <a href="https://man.page/2/setrlimit">setrlimit(2)</a>), or the call was
interrupted by a signal handler after having written less
than <i>count</i> bytes. (See also <a href="https://man.page/7/pipe">pipe(7)</a>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a seekable
file (i.e., one to which <a href="https://man.page/2/lseek">lseek(2)</a> may be applied, for
example, a regular file) writing takes place at the file
offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number of
bytes actually written. If the file was <a href="https://man.page/2/open">open(2)</a>ed
with <b>O_APPEND</b>, the file offset is first set to the
end of the file before writing. The adjustment of the file
offset and the write operation are performed as an atomic
step.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">POSIX requires
that a <a href="https://man.page/2/read">read(2)</a> that can be proved to occur after a
<b>write</b>() has returned will return the new data. Note
that not all filesystems are POSIX conforming.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">According to
POSIX.1, if <i>count</i> is greater than <b>SSIZE_MAX</b>,
the result is implementation-defined; see NOTES for the
upper limit on Linux.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On success, the
number of bytes written is returned. On error, -1 is
returned, and <i>errno</i> is set to indicate the cause of
the error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
successful <b>write</b>() may transfer fewer than
<i>count</i> bytes. Such partial writes can occur for
various reasons; for example, because there was insufficient
space on the disk device to write all of the requested
bytes, or because a blocked <b>write</b>() to a socket,
pipe, or similar was interrupted by a signal handler after
it had transferred some, but before it had transferred all
of the requested bytes. In the event of a partial write, the
caller can make another <b>write</b>() call to transfer the
remaining bytes. The subsequent call will either transfer
further bytes or may result in an error (e.g., if the disk
is now full).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>count</i>
is zero and <i>fd</i> refers to a regular file, then
<b>write</b>() may return a failure status if one of the
errors below is detected. If no errors are detected, or
error detection is not performed, 0 will be returned without
causing any other effect. If <i>count</i> is zero and
<i>fd</i> refers to a file other than a regular file, the
results are not specified.</p>

<p>A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the

written by an earlier <b>write</b>(), which may have been
issued to a different file descriptor on the same file.
Since Linux 4.13, errors from write-back come with a promise
that they <i>may</i> be reported by subsequent.
<b>write</b>() requests, and <i>will</i> be reported by a
subsequent <a href="https://man.page/2/fsync">fsync(2)</a> (whether or not they were also
reported by <b>write</b>()). An alternate cause of
<b>EIO</b> on networked filesystems is when an advisory lock
had been taken out on the file descriptor and this lock has
been lost. See the <i>Lost locks</i> section of
<a href="https://man.page/2/fcntl">fcntl(2)</a> for further details.</p></td></tr>

<p><i>fd</i> is connected to a pipe or socket whose reading
end is closed. When this happens the writing process will
also receive a <b>SIGPIPE</b> signal. (Thus, the write

ignores this signal.)</p></td></tr>

<h2>CONFORMING TO
<a name="CONFORMING TO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SVr4, 4.3BSD,
POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under SVr4 a
write may be interrupted and return <b>EINTR</b> at any
point, not just before any data is written.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The types
<i>size_t</i> and <i>ssize_t</i> are, respectively, unsigned
and signed integer data types specified by POSIX.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A successful
return from <b>write</b>() does not make any guarantee that
data has been committed to disk. On some filesystems,
including NFS, it does not even guarantee that space has
successfully been reserved for the data. In this case, some
errors might be delayed until a future <b>write</b>(),
<a href="https://man.page/2/fsync">fsync(2)</a>, or even <a href="https://man.page/2/close">close(2)</a>. The only way to be
sure is to call <a href="https://man.page/2/fsync">fsync(2)</a> after you are done writing
all your data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<b>write</b>() is interrupted by a signal handler before any
bytes are written, then the call fails with the error
<b>EINTR</b>; if it is interrupted after at least one byte
has been written, the call succeeds, and returns the number
of bytes written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Linux,
<b>write</b>() (and similar system calls) will transfer at
most 0x7ffff000 (2,147,479,552) bytes, returning the number
of bytes actually transferred. (This is true on both 32-bit
and 64-bit systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An error return
value while performing <b>write</b>() using direct I/O does
not mean the entire write has failed. Partial data may be
written and the data at the file offset on which the
<b>write</b>() was attempted should be considered
inconsistent.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">According to
POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4 Section XSI 2.9.7 (&quot;Thread
Interactions with Regular File Operations&quot;):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All of the
following functions shall be atomic with respect to each
other in the effects specified in POSIX.1-2008 when they
operate on regular files or symbolic links: ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Among the APIs
subsequently listed are <b>write</b>() and <a href="https://man.page/2/writev">writev(2)</a>.
And among the effects that should be atomic across threads
(and processes) are updates of the file offset. However, on
Linux before version 3.14, this was not the case: if two
processes that share an open file description (see
<a href="https://man.page/2/open">open(2)</a>) perform a <b>write</b>() (or
<a href="https://man.page/2/writev">writev(2)</a>) at the same time, then the I/O operations
were not atomic with respect updating the file offset, with
the result that the blocks of data output by the two
processes might (incorrectly) overlap. This problem was
fixed in Linux 3.14.</p>
