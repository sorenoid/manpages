<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>madvise</b>() system call is used to give advice or
directions to the kernel about the address range beginning
at address <i>addr</i> and with size <i>length</i> bytes In
most cases, the goal of such advice is to improve system or
application performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Initially, the
system call supported a set of &quot;conventional&quot;
<i>advice</i> values, which are also available on several
other implementations. (Note, though, that <b>madvise</b>()
is not specified in POSIX.) Subsequently, a number of
Linux-specific <i>advice</i> values have been added.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Conventional
advice values</b> <br>
The <i>advice</i> values listed below allow an application
to tell the kernel how it expects to use some mapped or
shared memory areas, so that the kernel can choose
appropriate read-ahead and caching techniques. These
<i>advice</i> values do not influence the semantics of the
application (except in the case of <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>),
but may influence its performance. All of the <i>advice</i>
values listed here have analogs in the POSIX-specified
<a href="https://man.page/3/posix_madvise">posix_madvise(3)</a> function, and the values have the
same meanings, with the exception of
<b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The advice is
indicated in the <i>advice</i> argument, which is one of the
following: <b><br>
MADV_NORMAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">No special treatment. This is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_RANDOM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Expect page references in
random order. (Hence, read ahead may be less useful than
normally.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_SEQUENTIAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Expect page references in
sequential order. (Hence, pages in the given range can be
aggressively read ahead, and may be freed soon after they
are accessed.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_WILLNEED</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Expect access in the near
future. (Hence, it might be a good idea to read some pages
ahead.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_DONTNEED</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not expect access in the
near future. (For the time being, the application is
finished with the given range, so the kernel can free
resources associated with it.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">After a
successful <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b> operation, the semantics of
memory access in the specified region are changed:
subsequent accesses of pages in the range will succeed, but
will result in either repopulating the memory contents from
the up-to-date contents of the underlying mapped file (for
shared file mappings, shared anonymous mappings, and
shmem-based techniques such as System V shared memory
segments) or zero-fill-on-demand pages for anonymous private
mappings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that, when
applied to shared mappings, <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b> might not
lead to immediate freeing of the pages in the range. The
kernel is free to delay freeing the pages until an
appropriate moment. The resident set size (RSS) of the
calling process will be immediately reduced however.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>
cannot be applied to locked pages, Huge TLB pages, or
<b>VM_PFNMAP</b> pages. (Pages marked with the
kernel-internal <b>VM_PFNMAP</b> flag are special memory
areas that are not managed by the virtual memory subsystem.
Such pages are typically created by device drivers that map
the pages into user space.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Linux-specific
advice values</b> <br>
The following Linux-specific <i>advice</i> values have no
counterparts in the POSIX-specified <a href="https://man.page/3/posix_madvise">posix_madvise(3)</a>,
and may or may not have counterparts in the <b>madvise</b>()
interface available on other implementations. Note that some
of these operations change the semantics of memory accesses.
<b><br>
MADV_REMOVE</b> (since Linux 2.6.16)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Free up a given range of pages
and its associated backing store. This is equivalent to
punching a hole in the corresponding byte range of the
backing store (see <a href="https://man.page/2/fallocate">fallocate(2)</a>). Subsequent accesses
in the specified address range will see bytes containing
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The specified
address range must be mapped shared and writable. This flag
cannot be applied to locked pages, Huge TLB pages, or
<b>VM_PFNMAP</b> pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In the initial
implementation, only <a href="https://man.page/5/tmpfs">tmpfs(5)</a> was supported
<b>MADV_REMOVE</b>; but since Linux 3.5, any filesystem
which supports the <a href="https://man.page/2/fallocate">fallocate(2)</a>
<b>FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE</b> mode also supports
<b>MADV_REMOVE</b>. Hugetlbfs fails with the error
<b>EINVAL</b> and other filesystems fail with the error
<b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_DONTFORK</b> (since
Linux 2.6.16)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not make the pages in this
range available to the child after a <a href="https://man.page/2/fork">fork(2)</a>. This is
useful to prevent copy-on-write semantics from changing the
physical location of a page if the parent writes to it after
a <a href="https://man.page/2/fork">fork(2)</a>. (Such page relocations cause problems for
hardware that DMAs into the page.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_DOFORK</b> (since Linux
2.6.16)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Undo the effect of
<b>MADV_DONTFORK</b>, restoring the default behavior,
whereby a mapping is inherited across <a href="https://man.page/2/fork">fork(2)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_HWPOISON</b> (since
Linux 2.6.32)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Poison the pages in the range
specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i> and handle
subsequent references to those pages like a hardware memory
corruption. This operation is available only for privileged
(<b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>) processes. This operation may result
in the calling process receiving a <b>SIGBUS</b> and the
page being unmapped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This feature is
intended for testing of memory error-handling code; it is
available only if the kernel was configured with
<b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_MERGEABLE</b> (since
Linux 2.6.32)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable Kernel Samepage Merging
(KSM) for the pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i>
and <i>length</i>. The kernel regularly scans those areas of
user memory that have been marked as mergeable, looking for
pages with identical content. These are replaced by a single
write-protected page (which is automatically copied if a
process later wants to update the content of the page). KSM
merges only private anonymous pages (see
<a href="https://man.page/2/mmap">mmap(2)</a>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The KSM feature
is intended for applications that generate many instances of
the same data (e.g., virtualization systems such as KVM). It
can consume a lot of processing power; use with care. See
the Linux kernel source file
<i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/ksm.rst</i> for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>MADV_MERGEABLE</b> and <b>MADV_UNMERGEABLE</b> operations
are available only if the kernel was configured with
<b>CONFIG_KSM</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_UNMERGEABLE</b> (since
Linux 2.6.32)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Undo the effect of an earlier
<b>MADV_MERGEABLE</b> operation on the specified address
range; KSM unmerges whatever pages it had merged in the
address range specified by <i>addr</i> and
<i>length</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE</b> (since
Linux 2.6.33)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Soft offline the pages in the
range specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>. The memory
of each page in the specified range is preserved (i.e., when
next accessed, the same content will be visible, but in a
new physical page frame), and the original page is offlined
(i.e., no longer used, and taken out of normal memory
management). The effect of the <b>MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE</b>
operation is invisible to (i.e., does not change the
semantics of) the calling process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This feature is
intended for testing of memory error-handling code; it is
available only if the kernel was configured with
<b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b> (since
Linux 2.6.38)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable Transparent Huge Pages
(THP) for pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i> and
<i>length</i>. Currently, Transparent Huge Pages work only
with private anonymous pages (see <a href="https://man.page/2/mmap">mmap(2)</a>). The
kernel will regularly scan the areas marked as huge page
candidates to replace them with huge pages. The kernel will
also allocate huge pages directly when the region is
naturally aligned to the huge page size (see
<a href="https://man.page/2/posix_memalign">posix_memalign(2)</a>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This feature is
primarily aimed at applications that use large mappings of
data and access large regions of that memory at a time
(e.g., virtualization systems such as QEMU). It can very
easily waste memory (e.g., a 2&nbsp;MB mapping that only
ever accesses 1 byte will result in 2&nbsp;MB of wired
memory instead of one 4&nbsp;KB page). See the Linux kernel
source file
<i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.rst</i> for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Most common
kernels configurations provide <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b>-style
behavior by default, and thus <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b> is
normally not necessary. It is mostly intended for embedded
systems, where <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b>-style behavior may not
be enabled by default in the kernel. On such systems, this
flag can be used in order to selectively enable THP.
Whenever <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b> is used, it should always be
in regions of memory with an access pattern that the
developer knows in advance won&rsquo;t risk to increase the
memory footprint of the application when transparent
hugepages are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b> and <b>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE</b> operations
are available only if the kernel was configured with
<b>CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE</b> (since
Linux 2.6.38)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Ensures that memory in the
address range specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>
will not be backed by transparent hugepages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_DONTDUMP</b> (since
Linux 3.4)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Exclude from a core dump those
pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i> and
<i>length</i>. This is useful in applications that have
large areas of memory that are known not to be useful in a
core dump. The effect of <b>MADV_DONTDUMP</b> takes
precedence over the bit mask that is set via the
<i>/proc/[pid]/coredump_filter</i> file (see
<a href="https://man.page/5/core">core(5)</a>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_DODUMP</b> (since Linux
3.4)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Undo the effect of an earlier
<b>MADV_DONTDUMP</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_FREE</b> (since Linux
4.5)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The application no longer
requires the pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i> and
<i>len</i>. The kernel can thus free these pages, but the
freeing could be delayed until memory pressure occurs. For
each of the pages that has been marked to be freed but has
not yet been freed, the free operation will be canceled if
the caller writes into the page. After a successful
<b>MADV_FREE</b> operation, any stale data (i.e., dirty,
unwritten pages) will be lost when the kernel frees the
pages. However, subsequent writes to pages in the range will
succeed and then kernel cannot free those dirtied pages, so
that the caller can always see just written data. If there
is no subsequent write, the kernel can free the pages at any
time. Once pages in the range have been freed, the caller
will see zero-fill-on-demand pages upon subsequent page
references.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>MADV_FREE</b> operation can be applied only to private
anonymous pages (see <a href="https://man.page/2/mmap">mmap(2)</a>). In Linux before
version 4.12, when freeing pages on a swapless system, the
pages in the given range are freed instantly, regardless of
memory pressure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_WIPEONFORK</b> (since
Linux 4.14)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Present the child process with
zero-filled memory in this range after a <a href="https://man.page/2/fork">fork(2)</a>.
This is useful in forking servers in order to ensure that
sensitive per-process data (for example, PRNG seeds,
cryptographic secrets, and so on) is not handed to child
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>MADV_WIPEONFORK</b> operation can be applied only to
private anonymous pages (see <a href="https://man.page/2/mmap">mmap(2)</a>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Within the
child created by <a href="https://man.page/2/fork">fork(2)</a>, the <b>MADV_WIPEONFORK</b>
setting remains in place on the specified address range.
This setting is cleared during <a href="https://man.page/2/execve">execve(2)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MADV_KEEPONFORK</b> (since
Linux 4.14)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Undo the effect of an earlier
<b>MADV_WIPEONFORK</b>.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
