<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">close - close a
file descriptor</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>int
close(int</b> <i>fd</i><b>);</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>close</b>()
closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any
file and may be reused. Any record locks (see
<b>fcntl</b>(2)) held on the file it was associated with,
and owned by the process, are removed (regardless of the
file descriptor that was used to obtain the lock).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>fd</i> is
the last file descriptor referring to the underlying open
file description (see <b>open</b>(2)), the resources
associated with the open file description are freed; if the
file descriptor was the last reference to a file which has
been removed using <b>unlink</b>(2), the file is
deleted.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>close</b>()
returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned, and
<i>errno</i> is set appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">On NFS, these errors are not
normally reported against the first write which exceeds the
available storage space, but instead against a subsequent
<b>write</b>(2), <b>fsync</b>(2), or <b>close</b>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See NOTES for a
discussion of why <b>close</b>() should not be retried after
an error.</p>

<h2>CONFORMING TO
<a name="CONFORMING TO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">POSIX.1-2001,
POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A successful
close does not guarantee that the data has been successfully
saved to disk, as the kernel uses the buffer cache to defer
writes. Typically, filesystems do not flush buffers when a
file is closed. If you need to be sure that the data is
physically stored on the underlying disk, use
<b>fsync</b>(2). (It will depend on the disk hardware at
this point.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
close-on-exec file descriptor flag can be used to ensure
that a file descriptor is automatically closed upon a
successful <b>execve</b>(2); see <b>fcntl</b>(2) for
details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Multithreaded
processes and close()</b> <br>
It is probably unwise to close file descriptors while they
may be in use by system calls in other threads in the same
process. Since a file descriptor may be reused, there are
some obscure race conditions that may cause unintended side
effects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore,
consider the following scenario where two threads are
performing operations on the same file descriptor:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>One thread is blocked in an I/O system call on the file
descriptor. For example, it is trying to <b>write</b>(2) to
a pipe that is already full, or trying to <b>read</b>(2)
from a stream socket which currently has no available
data.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Another thread closes the file descriptor.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The behavior in
this situation varies across systems. On some systems, when
the file descriptor is closed, the blocking system call
returns immediately with an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Linux (and
possibly some other systems), the behavior is different. the
blocking I/O system call holds a reference to the underlying
open file description, and this reference keeps the
description open until the I/O system call completes. (See
<b>open</b>(2) for a discussion of open file descriptions.)
Thus, the blocking system call in the first thread may
successfully complete after the <b>close</b>() in the second
thread.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dealing with
error returns from close()</b> <br>
A careful programmer will check the return value of
<b>close</b>(), since it is quite possible that errors on a
previous <b>write</b>(2) operation are reported only on the
final <b>close</b>() that releases the open file
description. Failing to check the return value when closing
a file may lead to <i>silent</i> loss of data. This can
especially be observed with NFS and with disk quota.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note, however,
that a failure return should be used only for diagnostic
purposes (i.e., a warning to the application that there may
still be I/O pending or there may have been failed I/O) or
remedial purposes (e.g., writing the file once more or
creating a backup).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Retrying the
<b>close</b>() after a failure return is the wrong thing to
do, since this may cause a reused file descriptor from
another thread to be closed. This can occur because the
Linux kernel <i>always</i> releases the file descriptor
early in the close operation, freeing it for reuse; the
steps that may return an error, such as flushing data to the
filesystem or device, occur only later in the close
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many other
implementations similarly always close the file descriptor
(except in the case of <b>EBADF</b>, meaning that the file
descriptor was invalid) even if they subsequently report an
error on return from <b>close</b>(). POSIX.1 is currently
silent on this point, but there are plans to mandate this
behavior in the next major release of the standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A careful
programmer who wants to know about I/O errors may precede
<b>close</b>() with a call to <b>fsync</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>EINTR</b> error is a somewhat special case. Regarding the
<b>EINTR</b> error, POSIX.1-2008 says:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>close</b>() is interrupted by a signal that is to be
caught, it shall return -1 with <i>errno</i> set to
<b>EINTR</b> and the state of <i>fildes</i> is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This permits
the behavior that occurs on Linux and many other
implementations, where, as with other errors that may be
reported by <b>close</b>(), the file descriptor is
guaranteed to be closed. However, it also permits another
possibility: that the implementation returns an <b>EINTR</b>
error and keeps the file descriptor open. (According to its
documentation, HP-UX&rsquo;s <b>close</b>() does this.) The
caller must then once more use <b>close</b>() to close the
file descriptor, to avoid file descriptor leaks. This
divergence in implementation behaviors provides a difficult
hurdle for portable applications, since on many
implementations, <b>close</b>() must not be called again
after an <b>EINTR</b> error, and on at least one,
<b>close</b>() must be called again. There are plans to
address this conundrum for the next major release of the
POSIX.1 standard.</p>
