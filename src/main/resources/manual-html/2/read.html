<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">read - read
from a file descriptor</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ssize_t
read(int</b> <i>fd</i><b>, void *</b><i>buf</i><b>,
size_t</b> <i>count</i><b>);</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>read</b>()
attempts to read up to <i>count</i> bytes from file
descriptor <i>fd</i> into the buffer starting at
<i>buf</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On files that
support seeking, the read operation commences at the file
offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number of
bytes read. If the file offset is at or past the end of
file, no bytes are read, and <b>read</b>() returns zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>count</i>
is zero, <b>read</b>() <i>may</i> detect the errors
described below. In the absence of any errors, or if
<b>read</b>() does not check for errors, a <b>read</b>()
with a <i>count</i> of 0 returns zero and has no other
effects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">According to
POSIX.1, if <i>count</i> is greater than <b>SSIZE_MAX</b>,
the result is implementation-defined; see NOTES for the
upper limit on Linux.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On success, the
number of bytes read is returned (zero indicates end of
file), and the file position is advanced by this number. It
is not an error if this number is smaller than the number of
bytes requested; this may happen for example because fewer
bytes are actually available right now (maybe because we
were close to end-of-file, or because we are reading from a
pipe, or from a terminal), or because <b>read</b>() was
interrupted by a signal. See also NOTES.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On error, -1 is
returned, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately. In this
case, it is left unspecified whether the file position (if
any) changes.</p>

<h2>CONFORMING TO
<a name="CONFORMING TO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SVr4, 4.3BSD,
POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The types
<i>size_t</i> and <i>ssize_t</i> are, respectively, unsigned
and signed integer data types specified by POSIX.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Linux,
<b>read</b>() (and similar system calls) will transfer at
most 0x7ffff000 (2,147,479,552) bytes, returning the number
of bytes actually transferred. (This is true on both 32-bit
and 64-bit systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On NFS
filesystems, reading small amounts of data will update the
timestamp only the first time, subsequent calls may not do
so. This is caused by client side attribute caching, because
most if not all NFS clients leave <i>st_atime</i> (last file
access time) updates to the server, and client side reads
satisfied from the client&rsquo;s cache will not cause
<i>st_atime</i> updates on the server as there are no
server-side reads. UNIX semantics can be obtained by
disabling client-side attribute caching, but in most
situations this will substantially increase server load and
decrease performance.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">According to
POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4 Section XSI 2.9.7 (&quot;Thread
Interactions with Regular File Operations&quot;):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All of the
following functions shall be atomic with respect to each
other in the effects specified in POSIX.1-2008 when they
operate on regular files or symbolic links: ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Among the APIs
subsequently listed are <b>read</b>() and <b>readv</b>(2).
And among the effects that should be atomic across threads
(and processes) are updates of the file offset. However, on
Linux before version 3.14, this was not the case: if two
processes that share an open file description (see
<b>open</b>(2)) perform a <b>read</b>() (or <b>readv</b>(2))
at the same time, then the I/O operations were not atomic
with respect updating the file offset, with the result that
the reads in the two processes might (incorrectly) overlap
in the blocks of data that they obtained. This problem was
fixed in Linux 3.14.</p>
