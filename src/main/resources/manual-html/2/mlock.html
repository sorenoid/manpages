<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mlock</b>(),
<b>mlock2</b>(), and <b>mlockall</b>() lock part or all of
the calling process&rsquo;s virtual address space into RAM,
preventing that memory from being paged to the swap
area.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>munlock</b>()
and <b>munlockall</b>() perform the converse operation,
unlocking part or all of the calling process&rsquo;s virtual
address space, so that pages in the specified virtual
address range may once more to be swapped out if required by
the kernel memory manager.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Memory locking
and unlocking are performed in units of whole pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mlock(),
mlock2(), and munlock() <br>
mlock</b>() locks pages in the address range starting at
<i>addr</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes. All pages
that contain a part of the specified address range are
guaranteed to be resident in RAM when the call returns
successfully; the pages are guaranteed to stay in RAM until
later unlocked.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mlock2</b>()
also locks pages in the specified range starting at
<i>addr</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes. However,
the state of the pages contained in that range after the
call returns successfully will depend on the value in the
<i>flags</i> argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>flags</i> argument can be either 0 or the following
constant: <b><br>
MLOCK_ONFAULT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Lock pages that are currently
resident and mark the entire range so that the remaining
nonresident pages are locked when they are populated by a
page fault.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>flags</i>
is 0, <b>mlock2</b>() behaves exactly the same as
<b>mlock</b>().</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>munlock</b>()
unlocks pages in the address range starting at <i>addr</i>
and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes. After this call, all
pages that contain a part of the specified memory range can
be moved to external swap space again by the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mlockall()
and munlockall() <br>
mlockall</b>() locks all pages mapped into the address space
of the calling process. This includes the pages of the code,
data and stack segment, as well as shared libraries, user
space kernel data, shared memory, and memory-mapped files.
All mapped pages are guaranteed to be resident in RAM when
the call returns successfully; the pages are guaranteed to
stay in RAM until later unlocked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>flags</i> argument is constructed as the bitwise OR of
one or more of the following constants: <b><br>
MCL_CURRENT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Lock all pages which are
currently mapped into the address space of the process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MCL_FUTURE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Lock all pages which will
become mapped into the address space of the process in the
future. These could be, for instance, new pages required by
a growing heap and stack as well as new memory-mapped files
or shared memory regions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MCL_ONFAULT</b> (since Linux
4.4)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used together with
<b>MCL_CURRENT</b>, <b>MCL_FUTURE</b>, or both. Mark all
current (with <b>MCL_CURRENT</b>) or future (with
<b>MCL_FUTURE</b>) mappings to lock pages when they are
faulted in. When used with <b>MCL_CURRENT</b>, all present
pages are locked, but <b>mlockall</b>() will not fault in
non-present pages. When used with <b>MCL_FUTURE</b>, all
future mappings will be marked to lock pages when they are
faulted in, but they will not be populated by the lock when
the mapping is created. <b>MCL_ONFAULT</b> must be used with
either <b>MCL_CURRENT</b> or <b>MCL_FUTURE</b> or both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>MCL_FUTURE</b> has been specified, then a later system
call (e.g., <a href="https://man.page/2/mmap">mmap(2)</a>, <a href="https://man.page/2/sbrk">sbrk(2)</a>,
<a href="https://man.page/3/malloc">malloc(3)</a>), may fail if it would cause the number of
locked bytes to exceed the permitted maximum (see below). In
the same circumstances, stack growth may likewise fail: the
kernel will deny stack expansion and deliver a
<b>SIGSEGV</b> signal to the process.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>munlockall</b>()
unlocks all pages mapped into the address space of the
calling process.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On success,
these system calls return 0. On error, -1 is returned,
<i>errno</i> is set appropriately, and no changes are made
to any locks in the address space of the process.</p>

<h2>VERSIONS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mlock2</b>()
is Linux specific.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On POSIX
systems on which <b>mlock</b>() and <b>munlock</b>() are
available, <b>_POSIX_MEMLOCK_RANGE</b> is defined in
<i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i> and the number of bytes in a page
can be determined from the constant <b>PAGESIZE</b> (if
defined) in <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> or by calling
<i>sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On POSIX
systems on which <b>mlockall</b>() and <b>munlockall</b>()
are available, <b>_POSIX_MEMLOCK</b> is defined in
<i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i> to a value greater than 0. (See also
<a href="https://man.page/3/sysconf">sysconf(3)</a>.)</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Memory locking
has two main applications: real-time algorithms and
high-security data processing. Real-time applications
require deterministic timing, and, like scheduling, paging
is one major cause of unexpected program execution delays.
Real-time applications will usually also switch to a
real-time scheduler with <a href="https://man.page/2/sched_setscheduler">sched_setscheduler(2)</a>.
Cryptographic security software often handles critical bytes
like passwords or secret keys as data structures. As a
result of paging, these secrets could be transferred onto a
persistent swap store medium, where they might be accessible
to the enemy long after the security software has erased the
secrets in RAM and terminated. (But be aware that the
suspend mode on laptops and some desktop computers will save
a copy of the system&rsquo;s RAM to disk, regardless of
memory locks.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Real-time
processes that are using <b>mlockall</b>() to prevent delays
on page faults should reserve enough locked stack pages
before entering the time-critical section, so that no page
fault can be caused by function calls. This can be achieved
by calling a function that allocates a sufficiently large
automatic variable (an array) and writes to the memory
occupied by this array in order to touch these stack pages.
This way, enough pages will be mapped for the stack and can
be locked into RAM. The dummy writes ensure that not even
copy-on-write page faults can occur in the critical
section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Memory locks
are not inherited by a child created via <a href="https://man.page/2/fork">fork(2)</a> and
are automatically removed (unlocked) during an
<a href="https://man.page/2/execve">execve(2)</a> or when the process terminates. The
<b>mlockall</b>() <b>MCL_FUTURE</b> and <b>MCL_FUTURE |
MCL_ONFAULT</b> settings are not inherited by a child
created via <a href="https://man.page/2/fork">fork(2)</a> and are cleared during an
<a href="https://man.page/2/execve">execve(2)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<a href="https://man.page/2/fork">fork(2)</a> will prepare the address space for a
copy-on-write operation. The consequence is that any write
access that follows will cause a page fault that in turn may
cause high latencies for a real-time process. Therefore, it
is crucial not to invoke <a href="https://man.page/2/fork">fork(2)</a> after an
<b>mlockall</b>() or <b>mlock</b>() operation&mdash;not even
from a thread which runs at a low priority within a process
which also has a thread running at elevated priority.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The memory lock
on an address range is automatically removed if the address
range is unmapped via <a href="https://man.page/2/munmap">munmap(2)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Memory locks do
not stack, that is, pages which have been locked several
times by calls to <b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(), or
<b>mlockall</b>() will be unlocked by a single call to
<b>munlock</b>() for the corresponding range or by
<b>munlockall</b>(). Pages which are mapped to several
locations or by several processes stay locked into RAM as
long as they are locked at least at one location or by at
least one process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a call to
<b>mlockall</b>() which uses the <b>MCL_FUTURE</b> flag is
followed by another call that does not specify this flag,
the changes made by the <b>MCL_FUTURE</b> call will be
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>mlock2</b>() <b>MLOCK_ONFAULT</b> flag and the
<b>mlockall</b>() <b>MCL_ONFAULT</b> flag allow efficient
memory locking for applications that deal with large
mappings where only a (small) portion of pages in the
mapping are touched. In such cases, locking all of the pages
in a mapping would incur a significant penalty for memory
locking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Linux
notes</b> <br>
Under Linux, <b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(), and
<b>munlock</b>() automatically round <i>addr</i> down to the
nearest page boundary. However, the POSIX.1 specification of
<b>mlock</b>() and <b>munlock</b>() allows an implementation
to require that <i>addr</i> is page aligned, so portable
applications should ensure this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>VmLck</i> field of the Linux-specific
<i>/proc/[pid]/status</i> file shows how many kilobytes of
memory the process with ID <i>PID</i> has locked using
<b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(), <b>mlockall</b>(), and
<a href="https://man.page/2/mmap">mmap(2)</a> <b>MAP_LOCKED</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Limits and
permissions</b> <br>
In Linux 2.6.8 and earlier, a process must be privileged
(<b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>) in order to lock memory and the
<b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b> soft resource limit defines a limit on
how much memory the process may lock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since Linux
2.6.9, no limits are placed on the amount of memory that a
privileged process can lock and the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b>
soft resource limit instead defines a limit on how much
memory an unprivileged process may lock.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Linux 4.8
and earlier, a bug in the kernel&rsquo;s accounting of
locked memory for unprivileged processes (i.e., without
<b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>) meant that if the region specified by
<i>addr</i> and <i>len</i> overlapped an existing lock, then
the already locked bytes in the overlapping region were
counted twice when checking against the limit. Such double
accounting could incorrectly calculate a &quot;total locked
memory&quot; value for the process that exceeded the
<b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b> limit, with the result that
<b>mlock</b>() and <b>mlock2</b>() would fail on requests
that should have succeeded. This bug was fixed in Linux
4.9.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the 2.4
series Linux kernels up to and including 2.4.17, a bug
caused the <b>mlockall</b>() <b>MCL_FUTURE</b> flag to be
inherited across a <a href="https://man.page/2/fork">fork(2)</a>. This was rectified in
kernel 2.4.18.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since kernel
2.6.9, if a privileged process calls
<i>mlockall(MCL_FUTURE)</i> and later drops privileges
(loses the <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b> capability by, for example,
setting its effective UID to a nonzero value), then
subsequent memory allocations (e.g., <a href="https://man.page/2/mmap">mmap(2)</a>,
<a href="https://man.page/2/brk">brk(2)</a>) will fail if the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b>
resource limit is encountered.</p>
