<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mmap</b>()
creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the
calling process. The starting address for the new mapping is
specified in <i>addr</i>. The <i>length</i> argument
specifies the length of the mapping (which must be greater
than 0).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>addr</i>
is NULL, then the kernel chooses the (page-aligned) address
at which to create the mapping; this is the most portable
method of creating a new mapping. If <i>addr</i> is not
NULL, then the kernel takes it as a hint about where to
place the mapping; on Linux, the kernel will pick a nearby
page boundary (but always above or equal to the value
specified by <i>/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr</i>) and attempt
to create the mapping there. If another mapping already
exists there, the kernel picks a new address that may or may
not depend on the hint. The address of the new mapping is
returned as the result of the call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The contents of
a file mapping (as opposed to an anonymous mapping; see
<b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> below), are initialized using
<i>length</i> bytes starting at offset <i>offset</i> in the
file (or other object) referred to by the file descriptor
<i>fd</i>. <i>offset</i> must be a multiple of the page size
as returned by <i>sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE)</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After the
<b>mmap</b>() call has returned, the file descriptor,
<i>fd</i>, can be closed immediately without invalidating
the mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>prot</i>
argument describes the desired memory protection of the
mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode of the
file). It is either <b>PROT_NONE</b> or the bitwise OR of
one or more of the following flags:</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The flags
argument</b> <br>
The <i>flags</i> argument determines whether updates to the
mapping are visible to other processes mapping the same
region, and whether updates are carried through to the
underlying file. This behavior is determined by including
exactly one of the following values in <i>flags</i>: <b><br>
MAP_SHARED</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Share this mapping. Updates to
the mapping are visible to other processes mapping the same
region, and (in the case of file-backed mappings) are
carried through to the underlying file. (To precisely
control when updates are carried through to the underlying
file requires the use of <b>msync</b>(2).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b>
(since Linux 4.15)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This flag provides the same
behavior as <b>MAP_SHARED</b> except that <b>MAP_SHARED</b>
mappings ignore unknown flags in <i>flags</i>. By contrast,
when creating a mapping using <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b>,
the kernel verifies all passed flags are known and fails the
mapping with the error <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b> for unknown flags.
This mapping type is also required to be able to use some
mapping flags (e.g., <b>MAP_SYNC</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_PRIVATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create a private copy-on-write
mapping. Updates to the mapping are not visible to other
processes mapping the same file, and are not carried through
to the underlying file. It is unspecified whether changes
made to the file after the <b>mmap</b>() call are visible in
the mapped region.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both
<b>MAP_SHARED</b> and <b>MAP_PRIVATE</b> are described in
POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008. <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b> is
a Linux extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
zero or more of the following values can be ORed in
<i>flags</i>: <b><br>
MAP_32BIT</b> (since Linux 2.4.20, 2.6)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Put the mapping into the first
2 Gigabytes of the process address space. This flag is
supported only on x86-64, for 64-bit programs. It was added
to allow thread stacks to be allocated somewhere in the
first 2&nbsp;GB of memory, so as to improve context-switch
performance on some early 64-bit processors. Modern x86-64
processors no longer have this performance problem, so use
of this flag is not required on those systems. The
<b>MAP_32BIT</b> flag is ignored when <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_ANON</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Synonym for
<b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>; provided for compatibility with other
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The mapping is not backed by
any file; its contents are initialized to zero. The
<i>fd</i> argument is ignored; however, some implementations
require <i>fd</i> to be -1 if <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> (or
<b>MAP_ANON</b>) is specified, and portable applications
should ensure this. The <i>offset</i> argument should be
zero. The use of <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> in conjunction with
<b>MAP_SHARED</b> is supported on Linux only since kernel
2.4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_DENYWRITE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This flag is ignored. (Long
ago&mdash;Linux 2.0 and earlier&mdash;it signaled that
attempts to write to the underlying file should fail with
<b>ETXTBSY</b>. But this was a source of denial-of-service
attacks.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_EXECUTABLE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This flag is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_FILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Compatibility flag.
Ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_FIXED</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t interpret
<i>addr</i> as a hint: place the mapping at exactly that
address. <i>addr</i> must be suitably aligned: for most
architectures a multiple of the page size is sufficient;
however, some architectures may impose additional
restrictions. If the memory region specified by <i>addr</i>
and <i>len</i> overlaps pages of any existing mapping(s),
then the overlapped part of the existing mapping(s) will be
discarded. If the specified address cannot be used,
<b>mmap</b>() will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Software that
aspires to be portable should use the <b>MAP_FIXED</b> flag
with care, keeping in mind that the exact layout of a
process&rsquo;s memory mappings is allowed to change
significantly between kernel versions, C library versions,
and operating system releases. <i>Carefully read the
discussion of this flag in NOTES!</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b>
(since Linux 4.17)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This flag provides behavior
that is similar to <b>MAP_FIXED</b> with respect to the
<i>addr</i> enforcement, but differs in that
<b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> never clobbers a preexisting
mapped range. If the requested range would collide with an
existing mapping, then this call fails with the error
<b>EEXIST.</b> This flag can therefore be used as a way to
atomically (with respect to other threads) attempt to map an
address range: one thread will succeed; all others will
report failure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that older
kernels which do not recognize the
<b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> flag will typically (upon
detecting a collision with a preexisting mapping) fall back
to a &quot;non-<b>MAP_FIXED&quot; type of behavior:</b> they
will return an address that is different from the requested
address. Therefore, backward-compatible software should
check the returned address against the requested
address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_GROWSDOWN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This flag is used for stacks.
It indicates to the kernel virtual memory system that the
mapping should extend downward in memory. The return address
is one page lower than the memory area that is actually
created in the process&rsquo;s virtual address space.
Touching an address in the &quot;guard&quot; page below the
mapping will cause the mapping to grow by a page. This
growth can be repeated until the mapping grows to within a
page of the high end of the next lower mapping, at which
point touching the &quot;guard&quot; page will result in a
<b>SIGSEGV</b> signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_HUGETLB</b> (since Linux
2.6.32)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allocate the mapping using
&quot;huge pages.&quot; See the Linux kernel source file
<i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.rst</i> for
further information, as well as NOTES, below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_HUGE_2MB</b>,
<b>MAP_HUGE_1GB</b> (since Linux 3.8)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used in conjunction with
<b>MAP_HUGETLB</b> to select alternative hugetlb page sizes
(respectively, 2&nbsp;MB and 1&nbsp;GB) on systems that
support multiple hugetlb page sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">More generally,
the desired huge page size can be configured by encoding the
base-2 logarithm of the desired page size in the six bits at
the offset <b>MAP_HUGE_SHIFT</b>. (A value of zero in this
bit field provides the default huge page size; the default
huge page size can be discovered via the <i>Hugepagesize</i>
field exposed by <i>/proc/meminfo</i>.) Thus, the above two
constants are defined as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">#define
MAP_HUGE_2MB (21 &lt;&lt; MAP_HUGE_SHIFT) <br>
#define MAP_HUGE_1GB (30 &lt;&lt; MAP_HUGE_SHIFT)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The range of
huge page sizes that are supported by the system can be
discovered by listing the subdirectories in
<i>/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_LOCKED</b> (since Linux
2.5.37)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mark the mapped region to be
locked in the same way as <b>mlock</b>(2). This
implementation will try to populate (prefault) the whole
range but the <b>mmap</b>() call doesn&rsquo;t fail with
<b>ENOMEM</b> if this fails. Therefore major faults might
happen later on. So the semantic is not as strong as
<b>mlock</b>(2). One should use <b>mmap</b>() plus
<b>mlock</b>(2) when major faults are not acceptable after
the initialization of the mapping. The <b>MAP_LOCKED</b>
flag is ignored in older kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b> (since
Linux 2.5.46)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This flag is meaningful only in
conjunction with <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>. Don&rsquo;t perform
read-ahead: create page tables entries only for pages that
are already present in RAM. Since Linux 2.6.23, this flag
causes <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> to do nothing. One day, the
combination of <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> and <b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b>
may be reimplemented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_NORESERVE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not reserve swap space for
this mapping. When swap space is reserved, one has the
guarantee that it is possible to modify the mapping. When
swap space is not reserved one might get <b>SIGSEGV</b> upon
a write if no physical memory is available. See also the
discussion of the file <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>
in <b>proc</b>(5). In kernels before 2.6, this flag had
effect only for private writable mappings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_POPULATE</b> (since
Linux 2.5.46)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Populate (prefault) page tables
for a mapping. For a file mapping, this causes read-ahead on
the file. This will help to reduce blocking on page faults
later. <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> is supported for private mappings
only since Linux 2.6.23.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_STACK</b> (since Linux
2.6.27)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allocate the mapping at an
address suitable for a process or thread stack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This flag is
currently a no-op on Linux. However, by employing this flag,
applications can ensure that they transparently obtain
support if the flag is implemented in the future. Thus, it
is used in the glibc threading implementation to allow for
the fact that some architectures may (later) require special
treatment for stack allocations. A further reason to employ
this flag is portability: <b>MAP_STACK</b> exists (and has
an effect) on some other systems (e.g., some of the
BSDs).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_SYNC</b> (since Linux
4.15)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This flag is available only
with the <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b> mapping type; mappings
of type <b>MAP_SHARED</b> will silently ignore this flag.
This flag is supported only for files supporting DAX (direct
mapping of persistent memory). For other files, creating a
mapping with this flag results in an <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Shared file
mappings with this flag provide the guarantee that while
some memory is mapped writable in the address space of the
process, it will be visible in the same file at the same
offset even after the system crashes or is rebooted. In
conjunction with the use of appropriate CPU instructions,
this provides users of such mappings with a more efficient
way of making data modifications persistent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAP_UNINITIALIZED</b> (since
Linux 2.6.33)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t clear anonymous
pages. This flag is intended to improve performance on
embedded devices. This flag is honored only if the kernel
was configured with the
<b>CONFIG_MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED</b> option. Because of
the security implications, that option is normally enabled
only on embedded devices (i.e., devices where one has
complete control of the contents of user memory).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of the above
flags, only <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is specified in POSIX.1-2001
and POSIX.1-2008. However, most systems also support
<b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> (or its synonym <b>MAP_ANON</b>).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>munmap()</b>
<br>
The <b>munmap</b>() system call deletes the mappings for the
specified address range, and causes further references to
addresses within the range to generate invalid memory
references. The region is also automatically unmapped when
the process is terminated. On the other hand, closing the
file descriptor does not unmap the region.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The address
<i>addr</i> must be a multiple of the page size (but
<i>length</i> need not be). All pages containing a part of
the indicated range are unmapped, and subsequent references
to these pages will generate <b>SIGSEGV</b>. It is not an
error if the indicated range does not contain any mapped
pages.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On success,
<b>mmap</b>() returns a pointer to the mapped area. On
error, the value <b>MAP_FAILED</b> (that is,
<i>(void&nbsp;*)&nbsp;-1</i>) is returned, and <i>errno</i>
is set to indicate the cause of the error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On success,
<b>munmap</b>() returns 0. On failure, it returns -1, and
<i>errno</i> is set to indicate the cause of the error
(probably to <b>EINVAL</b>).</p>

the same attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A file is
mapped in multiples of the page size. For a file that is not
a multiple of the page size, the remaining bytes in the
partial page at the end of the mapping are zeroed when
mapped, and modifications to that region are not written out
to the file. The effect of changing the size of the
underlying file of a mapping on the pages that correspond to
added or removed regions of the file is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some
hardware architectures (e.g., i386), <b>PROT_WRITE</b>
implies <b>PROT_READ</b>. It is architecture dependent
whether <b>PROT_READ</b> implies <b>PROT_EXEC</b> or not.
Portable programs should always set <b>PROT_EXEC</b> if they
intend to execute code in the new mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The portable
way to create a mapping is to specify <i>addr</i> as 0
(NULL), and omit <b>MAP_FIXED</b> from <i>flags</i>. In this
case, the system chooses the address for the mapping; the
address is chosen so as not to conflict with any existing
mapping, and will not be 0. If the <b>MAP_FIXED</b> flag is
specified, and <i>addr</i> is 0 (NULL), then the mapped
address will be 0 (NULL).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certain
<i>flags</i> constants are defined only if suitable feature
test macros are defined (possibly by default):
<b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b> with glibc 2.19 or later; or
<b>_BSD_SOURCE</b> or <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b> in glibc 2.19 and
earlier. (Employing <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b> also suffices, and
requiring that macro specifically would have been more
logical, since these flags are all Linux-specific.) The
relevant flags are: <b>MAP_32BIT</b>, <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>
(and the synonym <b>MAP_ANON</b>), <b>MAP_DENYWRITE</b>,
<b>MAP_EXECUTABLE</b>, <b>MAP_FILE</b>,
<b>MAP_GROWSDOWN</b>, <b>MAP_HUGETLB</b>, <b>MAP_LOCKED</b>,
<b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b>, <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>,
<b>MAP_POPULATE</b>, and <b>MAP_STACK</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An application
can determine which pages of a mapping are currently
resident in the buffer/page cache using
<b>mincore</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
MAP_FIXED safely</b> <br>
The only safe use for <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is where the address
range specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i> was
previously reserved using another mapping; otherwise, the
use of <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is hazardous because it forcibly
removes preexisting mappings, making it easy for a
multithreaded process to corrupt its own address space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
suppose that thread A looks through
<i>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</i> in order to locate an unused
address range that it can map using <b>MAP_FIXED</b>, while
thread B simultaneously acquires part or all of that same
address range. When thread A subsequently employs
<b>mmap(MAP_FIXED)</b>, it will effectively clobber the
mapping that thread B created. In this scenario, thread B
need not create a mapping directly; simply making a library
call that, internally, uses <b>dlopen</b>(3) to load some
other shared library, will suffice. The <b>dlopen</b>(3)
call will map the library into the process&rsquo;s address
space. Furthermore, almost any library call may be
implemented in a way that adds memory mappings to the
address space, either with this technique, or by simply
allocating memory. Examples include <b>brk</b>(2),
<b>malloc</b>(3), <b>pthread_create</b>(3), and the PAM
libraries
<a href="http://www.linux-pam.org">http://www.linux-pam.org</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since Linux
4.17, a multithreaded program can use the
<b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> flag to avoid the hazard
described above when attempting to create a mapping at a
fixed address that has not been reserved by a preexisting
mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Timestamps
changes for file-backed mappings</b> <br>
For file-backed mappings, the <i>st_atime</i> field for the
mapped file may be updated at any time between the
<b>mmap</b>() and the corresponding unmapping; the first
reference to a mapped page will update the field if it has
not been already.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>st_ctime</i> and <i>st_mtime</i> field for a file mapped
with <b>PROT_WRITE</b> and <b>MAP_SHARED</b> will be updated
after a write to the mapped region, and before a subsequent
<b>msync</b>(2) with the <b>MS_SYNC</b> or <b>MS_ASYNC</b>
flag, if one occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Huge page
(Huge TLB) mappings</b> <br>
For mappings that employ huge pages, the requirements for
the arguments of <b>mmap</b>() and <b>munmap</b>() differ
somewhat from the requirements for mappings that use the
native system page size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
<b>mmap</b>(), <i>offset</i> must be a multiple of the
underlying huge page size. The system automatically aligns
<i>length</i> to be a multiple of the underlying huge page
size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
<b>munmap</b>(), <i>addr</i>, and <i>length</i> must both be
a multiple of the underlying huge page size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>C
library/kernel differences</b> <br>
This page describes the interface provided by the glibc
<b>mmap</b>() wrapper function. Originally, this function
invoked a system call of the same name. Since kernel 2.4,
that system call has been superseded by <b>mmap2</b>(2), and
nowadays the glibc <b>mmap</b>() wrapper function invokes
<b>mmap2</b>(2) with a suitably adjusted value for
<i>offset</i>.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Linux, there
are no guarantees like those suggested above under
<b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>. By default, any process can be killed
at any moment when the system runs out of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In kernels
before 2.6.7, the <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> flag has effect only
if <i>prot</i> is specified as <b>PROT_NONE</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SUSv3 specifies
that <b>mmap</b>() should fail if <i>length</i> is 0.
However, in kernels before 2.6.12, <b>mmap</b>() succeeded
in this case: no mapping was created and the call returned
<i>addr</i>. Since kernel 2.6.12, <b>mmap</b>() fails with
the error <b>EINVAL</b> for this case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">POSIX specifies
that the system shall always zero fill any partial page at
the end of the object and that system will never write any
modification of the object beyond its end. On Linux, when
you write data to such partial page after the end of the
object, the data stays in the page cache even after the file
is closed and unmapped and even though the data is never
written to the file itself, subsequent mappings may see the
modified content. In some cases, this could be fixed by
calling <b>msync</b>(2) before the unmap takes place;
however, this doesn&rsquo;t work on <b>tmpfs</b>(5) (for
example, when using the POSIX shared memory interface
documented in <b>shm_overview</b>(7)).</p>
