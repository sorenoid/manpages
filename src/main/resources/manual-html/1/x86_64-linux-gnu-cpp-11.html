useful options are given above; see below for a more

<b>cpp</b> accepts most <b>gcc</b> driver options, which are
not listed here. Refer to the <small>GCC</small>
documentation for details.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The C
preprocessor, often known as <i>cpp</i>, is a <i>macro
processor</i> that is used automatically by the C compiler
to transform your program before compilation. It is called a
macro processor because it allows you to define
<i>macros</i>, which are brief abbreviations for longer
constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The C
preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C
<small>++</small> , and Objective-C source code. In the
past, it has been abused as a general text processor. It
will choke on input which does not obey C&rsquo;s lexical
rules. For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the
beginning of character constants, and cause errors. Also,
you cannot rely on it preserving characteristics of the
input which are not significant to C-family languages. If a
Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs will be removed,
and the Makefile will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Having said
that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which
are not C. Other Algol-ish programming languages are often
safe (Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.
<b>-traditional-cpp</b> mode preserves more white space, and
is otherwise more permissive. Many of the problems can be
avoided by writing C or C <small>++</small> style comments
instead of native language comments, and keeping macros
simple.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Wherever
possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the
language you are writing in. Modern versions of the
<small>GNU</small> assembler have macro facilities. Most
high level programming languages have their own conditional
compilation and inclusion mechanism. If all else fails, try
a true general text processor, such as <small>GNU
M4.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">C preprocessors
vary in some details. This manual discusses the <small>GNU
C</small> preprocessor, which provides a small superset of
the features of <small>ISO</small> Standard C. In its
default mode, the <small>GNU C</small> preprocessor does not
do a few things required by the standard. These are features
which are rarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising
changes to the meaning of a program which does not expect
them. To get strict <small>ISO</small> Standard C, you
should use the <b>-std=c90</b>, <b>-std=c99</b>,
<b>-std=c11</b> or <b>-std=c17</b> options, depending on
which version of the standard you want. To get all the
mandatory diagnostics, you must also use
<b>-pedantic</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
describes the behavior of the <small>ISO</small>
preprocessor. To minimize gratuitous differences, where the
<small>ISO</small> preprocessor&rsquo;s behavior does not
conflict with traditional semantics, the traditional
preprocessor should behave the same way. The various
differences that do exist are detailed in the section
<b>Traditional Mode</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For clarity,
unless noted otherwise, references to
<b><small>CPP</small></b> in this manual refer to <small>GNU
CPP.</small></p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>cpp</b>
command expects two file names as arguments, <i>infile</i>
and <i>outfile</i>. The preprocessor reads <i>infile</i>
together with any other files it specifies with
<b>#include</b>. All the output generated by the combined
input files is written in <i>outfile</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Either
<i>infile</i> or <i>outfile</i> may be <b>-</b>, which as
<i>infile</i> means to read from standard input and as
<i>outfile</i> means to write to standard output. If either
file is omitted, it means the same as if <b>-</b> had been
specified for that file. You can also use the <b>-o</b>
<i>outfile</i> option to specify the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless
otherwise noted, or the option ends in <b>=</b>, all options
which take an argument may have that argument appear either
immediately after the option, or with a space between option
and argument: <b>-Ifoo</b> and <b>-I foo</b> have the same
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many options
have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
options may <i>not</i> be grouped: <b>-dM</b> is very
different from <b>-d&nbsp;-M</b>. <b><br>
-D</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Predefine <i>name</i> as a
macro, with definition 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-D</b>
<i>name</i><b>=</b><i>definition</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The contents of
<i>definition</i> are tokenized and processed as if they
appeared during translation phase three in a <b>#define</b>
directive. In particular, the definition is truncated by
embedded newline characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program
you may need to use the shell&rsquo;s quoting syntax to
protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the
shell syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you wish to
define a function-like macro on the command line, write its
argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals
sign (if any). Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so
you should quote the option. With <b>sh</b> and <b>csh</b>,
<b>-D&rsquo;</b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>args...</i><b>)=</b><i>definition</i><b>&rsquo;</b>
works.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-D</b> and
<b>-U</b> options are processed in the order they are given
on the command line. All <b>-imacros</b> <i>file</i> and
<b>-include</b> <i>file</i> options are processed after all
<b>-D</b> and <b>-U</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-U</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Cancel any previous definition
of <i>name</i>, either built in or provided with a <b>-D</b>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-include</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Process <i>file</i> as if
&quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot; appeared as the first
line of the primary source file. However, the first
directory searched for <i>file</i> is the
preprocessor&rsquo;s working directory <i>instead of</i> the
directory containing the main source file. If not found
there, it is searched for in the remainder of the
&quot;#include &quot;...&quot;&quot; search chain as
normal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If multiple
<b>-include</b> options are given, the files are included in
the order they appear on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-imacros</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Exactly like <b>-include</b>,
except that any output produced by scanning <i>file</i> is
thrown away. Macros it defines remain defined. This allows
you to acquire all the macros from a header without also
processing its declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All files
specified by <b>-imacros</b> are processed before all files
specified by <b>-include</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-undef</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not predefine any
system-specific or GCC-specific macros. The standard
predefined macros remain defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-pthread</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Define additional macros
required for using the <small>POSIX</small> threads library.
You should use this option consistently for both compilation
and linking. This option is supported on GNU/Linux targets,
most other Unix derivatives, and also on x86 Cygwin and
MinGW targets.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-M</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing,
output a rule suitable for <b>make</b> describing the
dependencies of the main source file. The preprocessor
outputs one <b>make</b> rule containing the object file name
for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the
included files, including those coming from <b>-include</b>
or <b>-imacros</b> command-line options.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unless
specified explicitly (with <b>-MT</b> or <b>-MQ</b>), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file
with any suffix replaced with object file suffix and with
any leading directory parts removed. If there are many
included files then the rule is split into several lines
using <b>\</b>-newline. The rule has no commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option
does not suppress the preprocessor&rsquo;s debug output,
such as <b>-dM</b>. To avoid mixing such debug output with
the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the
dependency output file with <b>-MF</b>, or use an
environment variable like
<b><small>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</small></b> . Debug output is
still sent to the regular output stream as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Passing
<b>-M</b> to the driver implies <b>-E</b>, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit <b>-w</b>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-MM</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like <b>-M</b> but do not
mention header files that are found in system header
directories, nor header files that are included, directly or
indirectly, from such a header.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This implies
that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
<b>#include</b> directive does not in itself determine
whether that header appears in <b>-MM</b> dependency
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-MF</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>-M</b> or
<b>-MM</b>, specifies a file to write the dependencies to.
If no <b>-MF</b> switch is given the preprocessor sends the
rules to the same place it would send preprocessed
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
the driver options <b>-MD</b> or <b>-MMD</b>, <b>-MF</b>
overrides the default dependency output file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>file</i>
is <i>-</i>, then the dependencies are written to
<i>stdout</i>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><b>-MG</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>In conjunction with an option such as <b>-M</b>
requesting dependency generation, <b>-MG</b> assumes missing
header files are generated files and adds them to the
dependency list without raising an error. The dependency
filename is taken directly from the &quot;#include&quot;
directive without prepending any path. <b>-MG</b> also
suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file
renders this useless.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This feature is
used in automatic updating of makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-Mno-modules</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disable dependency generation
for compiled module interfaces.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><b>-MP</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>This option instructs <small>CPP</small> to add a phony
target for each dependency other than the main file, causing
each to depend on nothing. These dummy rules work around
errors <b>make</b> gives if you remove header files without
updating the <i>Makefile</i> to match.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is typical
output:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">test.o: test.c
test.h <br>
test.h:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-MT</b> <i>target</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Change the target of the rule
emitted by dependency generation. By default
<small>CPP</small> takes the name of the main input file,
deletes any directory components and any file suffix such as
<b>.c</b>, and appends the platform&rsquo;s usual object
suffix. The result is the target.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">An <b>-MT</b>
option sets the target to be exactly the string you specify.
If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a
single argument to <b>-MT</b>, or use multiple <b>-MT</b>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
<b>-MT&nbsp;&rsquo;$(objpfx)foo.o&rsquo;</b> might give</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$(objpfx)foo.o:
foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-MQ</b> <i>target</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as <b>-MT</b>, but it
quotes any characters which are special to Make.
<b>-MQ&nbsp;&rsquo;$(objpfx)foo.o&rsquo;</b> gives</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$$(objpfx)foo.o:
foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
<b>-MQ</b>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><b>-MD</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p><b>-MD</b> is equivalent to <b>-M -MF</b> <i>file</i>,
except that <b>-E</b> is not implied. The driver determines
<i>file</i> based on whether an <b>-o</b> option is given.
If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix of
<i>.d</i>, otherwise it takes the name of the input file,
removes any directory components and suffix, and applies a
<i>.d</i> suffix.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>-MD</b>
is used in conjunction with <b>-E</b>, any <b>-o</b> switch
is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if
used without <b>-E</b>, each <b>-o</b> is understood to
specify a target object file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since <b>-E</b>
is not implied, <b>-MD</b> can be used to generate a
dependency output file as a side effect of the compilation
process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-MMD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like <b>-MD</b> except mention
only user header files, not system header files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-fpreprocessed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Indicate to the preprocessor
that the input file has already been preprocessed. This
suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph conversion,
escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so
that you can pass a file preprocessed with <b>-C</b> to the
compiler without problems. In this mode the integrated
preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front
ends.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-fpreprocessed</b>
is implicit if the input file has one of the extensions
<b>.i</b>, <b>.ii</b> or <b>.mi</b>. These are the
extensions that <small>GCC</small> uses for preprocessed
files created by <b>-save-temps</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-fdirectives-only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When preprocessing, handle
directives, but do not expand macros.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
option&rsquo;s behavior depends on the <b>-E</b> and
<b>-fpreprocessed</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With <b>-E</b>,
preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives such
as &quot;#define&quot;, &quot;#ifdef&quot;, and
&quot;#error&quot;. Other preprocessor operations, such as
macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not performed.
In addition, the <b>-dD</b> option is implicitly
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>-fpreprocessed</b>, predefinition of command line and
most builtin macros is disabled. Macros such as
&quot;__LINE__&quot;, which are contextually dependent, are
handled normally. This enables compilation of files
previously preprocessed with &quot;-E
-fdirectives-only&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With both
<b>-E</b> and <b>-fpreprocessed</b>, the rules for
<b>-fpreprocessed</b> take precedence. This enables full
preprocessing of files previously preprocessed with &quot;-E
-fdirectives-only&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-fdollars-in-identifiers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Accept <b>$</b> in
identifiers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-fextended-identifiers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Accept universal character
names and extended characters in identifiers. This option is
enabled by default for C99 (and later C standard versions)
and C <small>++</small> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-fno-canonical-system-headers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When preprocessing, do not
shorten system header paths with canonicalization.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-fmax-include-depth=</b><i>depth</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the maximum depth of the
nested #include. The default is 200.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-ftabstop=</b><i>width</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the distance between tab
stops. This helps the preprocessor report correct column
numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line. If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the
option is ignored. The default is 8.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-ftrack-macro-expansion</b>[<b>=</b><i>level</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Track locations of tokens
across macro expansions. This allows the compiler to emit
diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack when a
compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The <i>level</i> parameter can be used to choose the
level of precision of token location tracking thus
decreasing the memory consumption if necessary. Value
<b>0</b> of <i>level</i> de-activates this option. Value
<b>1</b> tracks tokens locations in a degraded mode for the
sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode all tokens
resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value <b>2</b>
tracks tokens locations completely. This value is the most
memory hungry. When this option is given no argument, the
default parameter value is <b>2</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
&quot;-ftrack-macro-expansion=2&quot; is activated by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-fmacro-prefix-map=</b><i>old</i><b>=</b><i>new</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When preprocessing files
residing in directory <i>old</i>, expand the
&quot;__FILE__&quot; and &quot;__BASE_FILE__&quot; macros as
if the files resided in directory <i>new</i> instead. This
can be used to change an absolute path to a relative path by
using <i>.</i> for <i>new</i> which can result in more
reproducible builds that are location independent. This
option also affects &quot;__builtin_FILE()&quot; during
compilation. See also <b>-ffile-prefix-map</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-fexec-charset=</b><i>charset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the execution character
set, used for string and character constants. The default is
<small>UTF-8.</small> <i>charset</i> can be any encoding
supported by the system&rsquo;s &quot;iconv&quot; library
routine.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-fwide-exec-charset=</b><i>charset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the wide execution
character set, used for wide string and character constants.
The default is <small>UTF-32</small> or
<small>UTF-16,</small> whichever corresponds to the width of
&quot;wchar_t&quot;. As with <b>-fexec-charset</b>,
<i>charset</i> can be any encoding supported by the
system&rsquo;s &quot;iconv&quot; library routine; however,
you will have problems with encodings that do not fit
exactly in &quot;wchar_t&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-finput-charset=</b><i>charset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the input character set,
used for translation from the character set of the input
file to the source character set used by <small>GCC.</small>
If the locale does not specify, or <small>GCC</small> cannot
get this information from the locale, the default is
<small>UTF-8.</small> This can be overridden by either the
locale or this command-line option. Currently the
command-line option takes precedence if there&rsquo;s a
conflict. <i>charset</i> can be any encoding supported by
the system&rsquo;s &quot;iconv&quot; library routine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-fworking-directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable generation of
linemarkers in the preprocessor output that let the compiler
know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing. When this option is enabled, the preprocessor
emits, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker
with the current working directory followed by two slashes.
<small>GCC</small> uses this directory, when it&rsquo;s
present in the preprocessed input, as the directory emitted
as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats. This option is implicitly enabled if
debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited
with the negated form <b>-fno-working-directory</b>. If the
<b>-P</b> flag is present in the command line, this option
has no effect, since no &quot;#line&quot; directives are
emitted whatsoever.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-A</b>
<i>predicate</i><b>=</b><i>answer</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Make an assertion with the
predicate <i>predicate</i> and answer <i>answer</i>. This
form is preferred to the older form <b>-A</b>
<i>predicate</i><b>(</b><i>answer</i><b>)</b>, which is
still supported, because it does not use shell special
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-A
-</b><i>predicate</i><b>=</b><i>answer</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Cancel an assertion with the
predicate <i>predicate</i> and answer <i>answer</i>.</p>

the line is no longer a <b>#</b>.</p>

the time it is redefined or undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Built-in

a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then the preprocessor reports it as

improve the scope of the macro&rsquo;s definition by, for
example, moving it into the first skipped block.

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
describes the environment variables that affect how
<small>CPP</small> operates. You can use them to specify
directories or prefixes to use when searching for include
files, or to control dependency output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
can also specify places to search using options such as
<b>-I</b>, and control dependency output with options like
<b>-M</b>. These take precedence over environment variables,
which in turn take precedence over the configuration of
<small>GCC. <b><br>
CPATH</b></small> <b><br>
C_INCLUDE_PATH <small><br>
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Each variable&rsquo;s value is
a list of directories separated by a special character, much
like <b><small>PATH</small></b> , in which to look for
header files. The special character,
&quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;, is target-dependent and
determined at <small>GCC</small> build time. For Microsoft
Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all
other targets it is a colon.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>CPATH</small></b>
specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with <b>-I</b>, but after any paths given with
<b>-I</b> options on the command line. This environment
variable is used regardless of which language is being
preprocessed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The remaining
environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated. Each specifies a list of
directories to be searched as if specified with
<b>-isystem</b>, but after any paths given with
<b>-isystem</b> options on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In all these
variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to search
its current working directory. Empty elements can appear at
the beginning or end of a path. For instance, if the value
of <b><small>CPATH</small></b> is
&quot;:/special/include&quot;, that has the same effect as
<b>-I.&nbsp;-I/special/include</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this variable is set, its
value specifies how to output dependencies for Make based on
the non-system header files processed by the compiler.
System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The value of
<b><small>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</small></b> can be just a file
name, in which case the Make rules are written to that file,
guessing the target name from the source file name. Or the
value can have the form <i>file target</i>, in which case
the rules are written to file <i>file</i> using
<i>target</i> as the target name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
this environment variable is equivalent to combining the
options <b>-MM</b> and <b>-MF</b>, with an optional
<b>-MT</b> switch too.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This variable is the same as
<b><small>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</small></b> (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it
implies <b>-M</b> rather than <b>-MM</b>. However, the
dependence on the main input file is omitted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this variable is set, its
value specifies a <small>UNIX</small> timestamp to be used
in replacement of the current date and time in the
&quot;__DATE__&quot; and &quot;__TIME__&quot; macros, so
that the embedded timestamps become reproducible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The value of
<b><small>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</small></b> must be a
<small>UNIX</small> timestamp, defined as the number of
seconds (excluding leap seconds) since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00
represented in <small>ASCII</small> ; identical to the
output of &quot;date +%s&quot; on GNU/Linux and other
systems that support the %s extension in the
&quot;date&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The value
should be a known timestamp such as the last modification
time of the source or package and it should be set by the
build process.</p>
