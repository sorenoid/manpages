<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Updates remote
refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to
complete the given refs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can make
interesting things happen to a repository every time you
push into it, by setting up <i>hooks</i> there. See
documentation for <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
command line does not specify where to push with the
<b>&lt;repository&gt;</b> argument, <b>branch.*.remote</b>
configuration for the current branch is consulted to
determine where to push. If the configuration is missing, it
defaults to <i>origin</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
command line does not specify what to push with
<b>&lt;refspec&gt;...</b> arguments or <b>--all</b>,
<b>--mirror</b>, <b>--tags</b> options, the command finds
the default <b>&lt;refspec&gt;</b> by consulting
<b>remote.*.push</b> configuration, and if it is not found,
honors <b>push.default</b> configuration to decide what to
push (See <b>git-config</b>(1) for the meaning of
<b>push.default</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When neither
the command-line nor the configuration specify what to push,
the default behavior is used, which corresponds to the
<b>simple</b> value for <b>push.default</b>: the current
branch is pushed to the corresponding upstream branch, but
as a safety measure, the push is aborted if the upstream
branch does not have the same name as the local one.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;repository&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;remote&quot;
repository that is destination of a push operation. This
parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS
below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES
below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;refspec&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify what destination ref to
update with what source object. The format of a
&lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus <b>+</b>,
followed by the source object &lt;src&gt;, followed by a
colon <b>:</b>, followed by the destination ref
&lt;dst&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The &lt;src&gt;
is often the name of the branch you would want to push, but
it can be any arbitrary &quot;SHA-1 expression&quot;, such
as <b>master~4</b> or <b>HEAD</b> (see
<b>gitrevisions</b>(7)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The &lt;dst&gt;
tells which ref on the remote side is updated with this
push. Arbitrary expressions cannot be used here, an actual
ref must be named. If <b>git push [&lt;repository&gt;]</b>
without any <b>&lt;refspec&gt;</b> argument is set to update
some ref at the destination with <b>&lt;src&gt;</b> with
<b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.push</b> configuration
variable, <b>:&lt;dst&gt;</b> part can be omitted&mdash;such
a push will update a ref that <b>&lt;src&gt;</b> normally
updates without any <b>&lt;refspec&gt;</b> on the command
line. Otherwise, missing <b>:&lt;dst&gt;</b> means to update
the same ref as the <b>&lt;src&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If &lt;dst&gt;
doesn&rsquo;t start with <b>refs/</b> (e.g.
<b>refs/heads/master</b>) we will try to infer where in
<b>refs/*</b> on the destination &lt;repository&gt; it
belongs based on the type of &lt;src&gt; being pushed and
whether &lt;dst&gt; is ambiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If
&lt;dst&gt; unambiguously refers to a ref on the
&lt;repository&gt; remote, then push to that ref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If
&lt;src&gt; resolves to a ref starting with refs/heads/ or
refs/tags/, then prepend that to &lt;dst&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Other
ambiguity resolutions might be added in the future, but for
now any other cases will error out with an error indicating
what we tried, and depending on the
<b>advice.pushUnqualifiedRefname</b> configuration (see
<b>git-config</b>(1)) suggest what refs/ namespace you may
have wanted to push to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The object
referenced by &lt;src&gt; is used to update the &lt;dst&gt;
reference on the remote side. Whether this is allowed
depends on where in <b>refs/*</b> the &lt;dst&gt; reference
lives as described in detail below, in those sections
&quot;update&quot; means any modifications except deletes,
which as noted after the next few sections are treated
differently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>refs/heads/*</b> namespace will only accept commit
objects, and updates only if they can be fast-forwarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>refs/tags/*</b> namespace will accept any kind of object
(as commits, trees and blobs can be tagged), and any updates
to them will be rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
possible to push any type of object to any namespace outside
of <b>refs/{tags,heads}/*</b>. In the case of tags and
commits, these will be treated as if they were the commits
inside <b>refs/heads/*</b> for the purposes of whether the
update is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I.e. a
fast-forward of commits and tags outside
<b>refs/{tags,heads}/*</b> is allowed, even in cases where
what&rsquo;s being fast-forwarded is not a commit, but a tag
object which happens to point to a new commit which is a
fast-forward of the commit the last tag (or commit)
it&rsquo;s replacing. Replacing a tag with an entirely
different tag is also allowed, if it points to the same
commit, as well as pushing a peeled tag, i.e. pushing the
commit that existing tag object points to, or a new tag
object which an existing commit points to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Tree and blob
objects outside of <b>refs/{tags,heads}/*</b> will be
treated the same way as if they were inside
<b>refs/tags/*</b>, any update of them will be rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All of the
rules described above about what&rsquo;s not allowed as an
update can be overridden by adding an the optional leading
<b>+</b> to a refspec (or using <b>--force</b> command line
option). The only exception to this is that no amount of
forcing will make the <b>refs/heads/*</b> namespace accept a
non-commit object. Hooks and configuration can also override
or amend these rules, see e.g.
<b>receive.denyNonFastForwards</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1)
and <b>pre-receive</b> and <b>update</b> in
<b>githooks</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Pushing an
empty &lt;src&gt; allows you to delete the &lt;dst&gt; ref
from the remote repository. Deletions are always accepted
without a leading <b>+</b> in the refspec (or
<b>--force</b>), except when forbidden by configuration or
hooks. See <b>receive.denyDeletes</b> in
<b>git-config</b>(1) and <b>pre-receive</b> and
<b>update</b> in <b>githooks</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The special
refspec <b>:</b> (or <b>+:</b> to allow non-fast-forward
updates) directs Git to push &quot;matching&quot; branches:
for every branch that exists on the local side, the remote
side is updated if a branch of the same name already exists
on the remote side.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tag
&lt;tag&gt;</b> means the same as
<b>refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--all</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Push all branches (i.e. refs
under <b>refs/heads/</b>); cannot be used with other
&lt;refspec&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--prune</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove remote branches that
don&rsquo;t have a local counterpart. For example a remote
branch <b>tmp</b> will be removed if a local branch with the
same name doesn&rsquo;t exist any more. This also respects
refspecs, e.g. <b>git push --prune remote
refs/heads/*:refs/tmp/*</b> would make sure that remote
<b>refs/tmp/foo</b> will be removed if <b>refs/heads/foo</b>
doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--mirror</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of naming each ref to
push, specifies that all refs under <b>refs/</b> (which
includes but is not limited to <b>refs/heads/</b>,
<b>refs/remotes/</b>, and <b>refs/tags/</b>) be mirrored to
the remote repository. Newly created local refs will be
pushed to the remote end, locally updated refs will be force
updated on the remote end, and deleted refs will be removed
from the remote end. This is the default if the
configuration option <b>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.mirror</b> is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-n,
--dry-run</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do everything except actually
send the updates.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--porcelain</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Produce machine-readable
output. The output status line for each ref will be
tab-separated and sent to stdout instead of stderr. The full
symbolic names of the refs will be given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-d,
--delete</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All listed refs are deleted
from the remote repository. This is the same as prefixing
all refs with a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--tags</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All refs under <b>refs/tags</b>
are pushed, in addition to refspecs explicitly listed on the
command line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--follow-tags</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Push all the refs that would be
pushed without this option, and also push annotated tags in
<b>refs/tags</b> that are missing from the remote but are
pointing at commit-ish that are reachable from the refs
being pushed. This can also be specified with configuration
variable <b>push.followTags</b>. For more information, see
<b>push.followTags</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]signed,
--signed=(true|false|if-asked)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">GPG-sign the push request to
update refs on the receiving side, to allow it to be checked
by the hooks and/or be logged. If <b>false</b> or
<b>--no-signed</b>, no signing will be attempted. If
<b>true</b> or <b>--signed</b>, the push will fail if the
server does not support signed pushes. If set to
<b>if-asked</b>, sign if and only if the server supports
signed pushes. The push will also fail if the actual call to
<b>gpg --sign</b> fails. See <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) for
the details on the receiving end.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]atomic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use an atomic transaction on
the remote side if available. Either all refs are updated,
or on error, no refs are updated. If the server does not
support atomic pushes the push will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-o
&lt;option&gt;, --push-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Transmit the given string to
the server, which passes them to the pre-receive as well as
the post-receive hook. The given string must not contain a
NUL or LF character. When multiple
<b>--push-option=&lt;option&gt;</b> are given, they are all
sent to the other side in the order listed on the command
line. When no <b>--push-option=&lt;option&gt;</b> is given
from the command line, the values of configuration variable
<b>push.pushOption</b> are used instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;,
--exec=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Path to the
<i>git-receive-pack</i> program on the remote end. Sometimes
useful when pushing to a remote repository over ssh, and you
do not have the program in a directory on the default
$PATH.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]force-with-lease,
--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;,
--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually, &quot;git push&quot;
refuses to update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of
the local ref used to overwrite it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option
overrides this restriction if the current value of the
remote ref is the expected value. &quot;git push&quot; fails
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Imagine that
you have to rebase what you have already published. You will
have to bypass the &quot;must fast-forward&quot; rule in
order to replace the history you originally published with
the rebased history. If somebody else built on top of your
original history while you are rebasing, the tip of the
branch at the remote may advance with their commit, and
blindly pushing with <b>--force</b> will lose their
work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option
allows you to say that you expect the history you are
updating is what you rebased and want to replace. If the
remote ref still points at the commit you specified, you can
be sure that no other people did anything to the ref. It is
like taking a &quot;lease&quot; on the ref without
explicitly locking it, and the remote ref is updated only if
the &quot;lease&quot; is still valid.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--force-with-lease</b>
alone, without specifying the details, will protect all
remote refs that are going to be updated by requiring their
current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch
we have for them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;</b>,
without specifying the expected value, will protect the
named ref (alone), if it is going to be updated, by
requiring its current value to be the same as the
remote-tracking branch we have for it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</b>
will protect the named ref (alone), if it is going to be
updated, by requiring its current value to be the same as
the specified value <b>&lt;expect&gt;</b> (which is allowed
to be different from the remote-tracking branch we have for
the refname, or we do not even have to have such a
remote-tracking branch when this form is used). If
<b>&lt;expect&gt;</b> is the empty string, then the named
ref must not already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that all
forms other than
<b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</b>
that specifies the expected current value of the ref
explicitly are still experimental and their semantics may
change as we gain experience with this feature.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;--no-force-with-lease&quot;
will cancel all the previous --force-with-lease on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A general note
on safety: supplying this option without an expected value,
i.e. as <b>--force-with-lease</b> or
<b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;</b> interacts very
badly with anything that implicitly runs <b>git fetch</b> on
the remote to be pushed to in the background, e.g. <b>git
fetch origin</b> on your repository in a cronjob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The protection
it offers over <b>--force</b> is ensuring that subsequent
changes your work wasn&rsquo;t based on aren&rsquo;t
clobbered, but this is trivially defeated if some background
process is updating refs in the background. We don&rsquo;t
have anything except the remote tracking info to go by as a
heuristic for refs you&rsquo;re expected to have seen &amp;
are willing to clobber.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If your editor
or some other system is running <b>git fetch</b> in the
background for you a way to mitigate this is to simply set
up another remote:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">git remote add
origin-push $(git config remote.origin.url) <br>
git fetch origin-push</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Now when the
background process runs <b>git fetch origin</b> the
references on <b>origin-push</b> won&rsquo;t be updated, and
thus commands like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">git push
--force-with-lease origin-push</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Will fail
unless you manually run <b>git fetch origin-push</b>. This
method is of course entirely defeated by something that runs
<b>git fetch --all</b>, in that case you&rsquo;d need to
either disable it or do something more tedious like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">git fetch #
update 'master' from remote <br>
git tag base master # mark our base point <br>
git rebase -i master # rewrite some commits <br>
git push --force-with-lease=master:base master:master</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I.e. create a
<b>base</b> tag for versions of the upstream code that
you&rsquo;ve seen and are willing to overwrite, then rewrite
history, and finally force push changes to <b>master</b> if
the remote version is still at <b>base</b>, regardless of
what your local <b>remotes/origin/master</b> has been
updated to in the background.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
specifying <b>--force-if-includes</b> as an ancillary option
along with <b>--force-with-lease[=&lt;refname&gt;]</b>
(i.e., without saying what exact commit the ref on the
remote side must be pointing at, or which refs on the remote
side are being protected) at the time of &quot;push&quot;
will verify if updates from the remote-tracking refs that
may have been implicitly updated in the background are
integrated locally before allowing a forced update.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-f, --force</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually, the command refuses to
update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref
used to overwrite it. Also, when <b>--force-with-lease</b>
option is used, the command refuses to update a remote ref
whose current value does not match what is expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This flag
disables these checks, and can cause the remote repository
to lose commits; use it with care.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>--force</b> applies to all the refs that are pushed,
hence using it with <b>push.default</b> set to
<b>matching</b> or with multiple push destinations
configured with <b>remote.*.push</b> may overwrite refs
other than the current branch (including local refs that are
strictly behind their remote counterpart). To force a push
to only one branch, use a <b>+</b> in front of the refspec
to push (e.g <b>git push origin +master</b> to force a push
to the <b>master</b> branch). See the
<b>&lt;refspec&gt;...</b> section above for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]force-if-includes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Force an update only if the tip
of the remote-tracking ref has been integrated locally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option
enables a check that verifies if the tip of the
remote-tracking ref is reachable from one of the
&quot;reflog&quot; entries of the local branch based in it
for a rewrite. The check ensures that any updates from the
remote have been incorporated locally by rejecting the
forced update if that is not the case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the option
is passed without specifying <b>--force-with-lease</b>, or
specified along with
<b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</b>, it
is a &quot;no-op&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Specifying
<b>--no-force-if-includes</b> disables this behavior.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--repo=&lt;repository&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option is equivalent to
the &lt;repository&gt; argument. If both are specified, the
command-line argument takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-u,
--set-upstream</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For every branch that is up to
date or successfully pushed, add upstream (tracking)
reference, used by argument-less <b>git-pull</b>(1) and
other commands. For more information, see
<b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</b> in
<b>git-config</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]thin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These options are passed to
<b>git-send-pack</b>(1). A thin transfer significantly
reduces the amount of sent data when the sender and receiver
share many of the same objects in common. The default is
<b>--thin</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suppress all output, including
the listing of updated refs, unless an error occurs.
Progress is not reported to the standard error stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-v,
--verbose</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Run verbosely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--progress</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Progress status is reported on
the standard error stream by default when it is attached to
a terminal, unless -q is specified. This flag forces
progress status even if the standard error stream is not
directed to a terminal.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--no-recurse-submodules,
--recurse-submodules=check|on-demand|only|no</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">May be used to make sure all
submodule commits used by the revisions to be pushed are
available on a remote-tracking branch. If <i>check</i> is
used Git will verify that all submodule commits that changed
in the revisions to be pushed are available on at least one
remote of the submodule. If any commits are missing the push
will be aborted and exit with non-zero status. If
<i>on-demand</i> is used all submodules that changed in the
revisions to be pushed will be pushed. If on-demand was not
able to push all necessary revisions it will also be aborted
and exit with non-zero status. If <i>only</i> is used all
submodules will be recursively pushed while the superproject
is left unpushed. A value of <i>no</i> or using
<b>--no-recurse-submodules</b> can be used to override the
push.recurseSubmodules configuration variable when no
submodule recursion is required.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]verify</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Toggle the pre-push hook (see
<b>githooks</b>(5)). The default is --verify, giving the
hook a chance to prevent the push. With --no-verify, the
hook is bypassed completely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-4, --ipv4</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use IPv4 addresses only,
ignoring IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-6, --ipv6</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use IPv6 addresses only,
ignoring IPv4 addresses.</p>

address of the remote server, and the path to the
repository. Depending on the transport protocol, some of
this information may be absent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Git supports
ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp, and
ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and
deprecated; do not use it).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The native
transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
should be used with caution on unsecured networks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
syntaxes may be used with them:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
[user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This syntax is
only recognized if there are no slashes before the first
colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a
colon. For example the local path <b>foo:bar</b> could be
specified as an absolute path or <b>./foo:bar</b> to avoid
being misinterpreted as an ssh url.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ssh and git
protocols additionally support ~username expansion:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
[user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For local
repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
syntaxes may be used:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
file:///path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These two
syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when
the former implies --local option. See <b>git-clone</b>(1)
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
clone</i>, <i>git fetch</i> and <i>git pull</i>, but not
<i>git push</i>, will also accept a suitable bundle file.
See <b>git-bundle</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When Git
doesn&rsquo;t know how to handle a certain transport
protocol, it attempts to use the
<i>remote-&lt;transport&gt;</i> remote helper, if one
exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following
syntax may be used:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
&lt;address&gt; may be a path, a server and path, or an
arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific remote
helper being invoked. See <b>gitremote-helpers</b>(7) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there are a
large number of similarly-named remote repositories and you
want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs
you use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can
create a configuration section of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[url
&quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;] <br>
insteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
with this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[url
&quot;git://git.host.xz/&quot;] <br>
insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/ <br>
insteadOf = work:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">a URL like
&quot;work:repo.git&quot; or like
&quot;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be rewritten in
any context that takes a URL to be
&quot;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a configuration
section of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[url
&quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;] <br>
pushInsteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
with this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[url
&quot;ssh://example.org/&quot;] <br>
pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">a URL like
&quot;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be
rewritten to &quot;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot;
for pushes, but pulls will still use the original URL.</p>

<h2>REMOTES
<a name="REMOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name of one
of the following can be used instead of a URL as
<b>&lt;repository&gt;</b> argument:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; a remote

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; a file
in the <b>$GIT_DIR/branches</b> directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of these

You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The status of
the push is output in tabular form, with each line
representing the status of a single ref. Each line is of the

did not force the update.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">remote
rejected</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The remote end refused the
update. Usually caused by a hook on the remote side, or
because the remote repository has one of the following

In the case of successfully pushed refs, no explanation is

described.</p>

<h2>NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS
<a name="NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When an update
changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used to
point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called
a fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of
A.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a
fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the
original commit A built on top of is a subset of the commits
the new commit B builds on top of. Hence, it does not lose
any history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In contrast, a
non-fast-forward update will lose history. For example,
suppose you and somebody else started at the same commit X,
and you built a history leading to commit B while the other
person built a history leading to commit A. The history
looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">B <br>
/ <br>
---X---A</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Further suppose
that the other person already pushed changes leading to A
back to the original repository from which you two obtained
the original commit X.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The push done
by the other person updated the branch that used to point at
commit X to point at commit A. It is a fast-forward.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But if you try
to push, you will attempt to update the branch (that now
points at A) with commit B. This does <i>not</i>
fast-forward. If you did so, the changes introduced by
commit A will be lost, because everybody will now start
building on top of B.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command by
default does not allow an update that is not a fast-forward
to prevent such loss of history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you do not
want to lose your work (history from X to B) or the work by
the other person (history from X to A), you would need to
first fetch the history from the repository, create a
history that contains changes done by both parties, and push
the result back.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can perform
&quot;git pull&quot;, resolve potential conflicts, and
&quot;git push&quot; the result. A &quot;git pull&quot; will
create a merge commit C between commits A and B.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">B---C <br>
/ / <br>
---X---A</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Updating A with
the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and your push
will be accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
you can rebase your change between X and B on top of A, with
&quot;git pull --rebase&quot;, and push the result back. The
rebase will create a new commit D that builds the change
between X and B on top of A.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">B D <br>
/ / <br>
---X---A</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Again, updating
A with this commit will fast-forward and your push will be
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is
another common situation where you may encounter
non-fast-forward rejection when you try to push, and it is
possible even when you are pushing into a repository nobody
else pushes into. After you push commit A yourself (in the
first picture in this section), replace it with &quot;git
commit --amend&quot; to produce commit B, and you try to
push it out, because forgot that you have pushed A out
already. In such a case, and only if you are certain that
nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier commit A (and
started building on top of it), you can run &quot;git push
--force&quot; to overwrite it. In other words, &quot;git
push --force&quot; is a method reserved for a case where you
do mean to lose history.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git
push</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Works like <b>git push
&lt;remote&gt;</b>, where &lt;remote&gt; is the current
branch&rsquo;s remote (or <b>origin</b>, if no remote is
configured for the current branch).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git push
origin</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Without additional
configuration, pushes the current branch to the configured
upstream (<b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</b> configuration
variable) if it has the same name as the current branch, and
errors out without pushing otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behavior of this command when no &lt;refspec&gt; is given
can be configured by setting the <b>push</b> option of the
remote, or the <b>push.default</b> configuration
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example, to
default to pushing only the current branch to <b>origin</b>
use <b>git config remote.origin.push HEAD</b>. Any valid
&lt;refspec&gt; (like the ones in the examples below) can be
configured as the default for <b>git push origin</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git push
origin :</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Push &quot;matching&quot;
branches to <b>origin</b>. See &lt;refspec&gt; in the
OPTIONS section above for a description of
&quot;matching&quot; branches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git push
origin master</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Find a ref that matches
<b>master</b> in the source repository (most likely, it
would find <b>refs/heads/master</b>), and update the same
ref (e.g. <b>refs/heads/master</b>) in <b>origin</b>
repository with it. If <b>master</b> did not exist remotely,
it would be created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git push
origin HEAD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A handy way to push the current
branch to the same name on the remote.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git push
mothership master:satellite/master dev:satellite/dev</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the source ref that matches
<b>master</b> (e.g. <b>refs/heads/master</b>) to update the
ref that matches <b>satellite/master</b> (most probably
<b>refs/remotes/satellite/master</b>) in the
<b>mothership</b> repository; do the same for <b>dev</b> and
<b>satellite/dev</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See the section
describing <b>&lt;refspec&gt;...</b> above for a discussion
of the matching semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is to
emulate <b>git fetch</b> run on the <b>mothership</b> using
<b>git push</b> that is run in the opposite direction in
order to integrate the work done on <b>satellite</b>, and is
often necessary when you can only make connection in one way
(i.e. satellite can ssh into mothership but mothership
cannot initiate connection to satellite because the latter
is behind a firewall or does not run sshd).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">After running
this <b>git push</b> on the <b>satellite</b> machine, you
would ssh into the <b>mothership</b> and run <b>git
merge</b> there to complete the emulation of <b>git pull</b>
that were run on <b>mothership</b> to pull changes made on
<b>satellite</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git push
origin HEAD:master</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Push the current branch to the
remote ref matching <b>master</b> in the <b>origin</b>
repository. This form is convenient to push the current
branch without thinking about its local name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git push
origin master:refs/heads/experimental</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create the branch
<b>experimental</b> in the <b>origin</b> repository by
copying the current <b>master</b> branch. This form is only
needed to create a new branch or tag in the remote
repository when the local name and the remote name are
different; otherwise, the ref name on its own will work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git push
origin :experimental</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Find a ref that matches
<b>experimental</b> in the <b>origin</b> repository (e.g.
<b>refs/heads/experimental</b>), and delete it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git push
origin +dev:master</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Update the origin
repository&rsquo;s master branch with the dev branch,
allowing non-fast-forward updates. <b>This can leave
unreferenced commits dangling in the origin repository.</b>
Consider the following situation, where a fast-forward is
not possible:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---A---B
origin/master <br>
\ <br>
X---Y---Z dev</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The above
command would change the origin repository to</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">A---B (unnamed
branch) <br>
/ <br>
o---o---o---X---Y---Z master</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Commits A and B
would no longer belong to a branch with a symbolic name, and
so would be unreachable. As such, these commits would be
removed by a <b>git gc</b> command on the origin
repository.</p>

<h2>SECURITY
<a name="SECURITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fetch and
push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from
stealing data from the other repository that was not
intended to be shared. If you have private data that you
need to protect from a malicious peer, your best option is
to store it in another repository. This applies to both
clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a server
are not effective for read access control; you should only
grant read access to a namespace to clients that you would
trust with read access to the entire repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The known
attack vectors are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. The victim
sends &quot;have&quot; lines advertising the IDs of objects
it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but can
be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also has them.
The attacker chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref
to X, but isn&rsquo;t required to send the content of X
because the victim already has it. Now the victim believes
that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back
to the attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward
for a client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X
in the namespace the client has access to and then fetching
it. The most likely way for a server to perform it on a
client is to &quot;merge&quot; X into a public branch and
hope that the user does additional work on this branch and
pushes it back to the server without noticing the
merge.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. As in #1,
the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim
sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the
attacker falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim
sends Y as a delta against X. The delta reveals regions of X
that are similar to Y to the attacker.</p>
