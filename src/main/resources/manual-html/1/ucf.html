Configuration File: preserve user changes in configuration
files</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ucf</b>
[<i>options</i>] <i>&lt;New File&gt;
&lt;Destination&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ucf</b>
[<i>options</i>] <i>--purge &lt;Destination&gt;</i></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This utility
provides a means of asking the user whether or not to accept
new versions of configuration files provided by the package
maintainer, with various heuristics designed to minimize
interaction time. It uses debconf to interact with the user,
as per Debian policy. In the SYNOPSIS above, <i>New file</i>
is the configuration file as provided by the package (either
shipped with the package, or generated by the maintainer
scripts on the fly), and <i>Destination</i> is the location
(usually under /etc) where the real configuration file
lives, and is potentially modified by the end user. Since
the files edited would be real files, and not symbolic
links, <b>ucf</b> follows and resolves symbolic links before
acting. As far as possible, ucf attempts to preserve the
ownership and permission of the <i>New file</i> as it is
copied to the new location.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This script
attempts to provide conffile like handling for files
installed under <i>/etc</i> not shipped in a <b>Debian</b>
package, but handled by the postinst instead. <b>Debian</b>
policy states that files under <i>/etc</i> which are
configuration files <b>must</b> preserve user changes, and
this applies to files handled by maintainer scripts as well.
Using <b>ucf,</b> one may ship a bunch of default
configuration files somewhere in <i>/usr</i> (
<i>/usr/share/&lt;pkg&gt;</i> is a good location), and
maintain files in <i>/etc,</i> preserving user changes and
in general offering the same facilities while upgrading that
<b>dpkg</b> normally provides for
<i>&ldquo;conffiles&rdquo;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
this script provides facilities for transitioning a file
that had not been provided <i>conffile</i> like protection
to come under this schema, and attempts to minimize
questions asked at install time. Indeed, the transitioning
facility is better than the one offered by <b>dpkg</b> while
transitioning a file from a <i>non-conffile</i> to
<i>conffile</i> status. The second form in the SYNOPSIS
above is for purging information about the configuration
file when the package is purged; and is critical for
allowing smooth reinstallations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During the
course of operations, when working with configuration files,
<b>ucf</b> optionally creates copies of versions of the
configuration file in question. For example, a file with the
suffix <i>ucf-old</i> holds the old version of a
configuration file replaced by <b>ucf.</b> Also, copies of
the configuration file with the suffixes <i>ucf-new</i> and
<i>ucf-dist</i> may be created; and the maintainer scripts
should consider purging copies of the configuration file
with these extensions during purge.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-h,
--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print a short usage message</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-n, --no-action</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Dry run. Print the actions that
would be taken if the script is invoked, but take no
action.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-d[n], --debug=[n]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the debug level to the
(optional) level <i>n</i> (n defaults to 1). Please note
there must be no spaces before the optional digit n. This
turns on copious debugging information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-p, --purge</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Removes all vestiges of the
file from the state hashfile. This is required to allow a
package to be reinstalled after it is purged; since
otherwise, the real configuration file is removed, but it
remains in the hash file; and on reinstall no action is
taken, since the md5sum of the new file matches that in the
hashfile. In short, remember to use this option in the
postrm for every configuration file managed by ucf when the
package is being purged (assuming ucf itself exists).
<i>Note:</i> ucf does not actually touch the file on disk in
this operation, so any file removals are still the
responsibility of the calling package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v, --verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Make the script be very verbose
about setting internal variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-P foo, --package
foo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t follow dpkg-divert
diversions by package foo when updating configuration
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-s foo, --src-dir
foo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the source directory
(historical md5sums are expected to live in files and sub
directories of this directory) to foo. By default, the
directory the new_file lives in is assumed to be the source
directory. Setting this option overrides settings in the
environment variable <b>UCF_SOURCE_DIR,</b> and in the
configuration file variable <b>conf_source_dir.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--sum-file foo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Force the historical md5sums to
be read from this file, rather than defaulting to living in
the source directory. Setting this option overrides settings
in the environment variable <b>UCF_OLD_MDSUM_FILE,</b> and
in the configuration file variable
<b>conf_old_mdsum_file.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--three-way</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This turns on the option,
during installation, for the user to be offered a chance to
see a merge of the changes between old maintainer version
and the new maintainer version into the local copy of the
configuration file. If the user likes what they see, they
can ask to have these changes merged in. This allows one to
get new upstream changes merged in even while retaining
local modifications to the configuration file. This is
accomplished by taking the configuration file and stashing
it in a cache area during registration, and using diff3
during the install (the stashed file name is a munged
version of the full path of the configuration file to avoid
name space clashes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--debconf-ok</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Indicate that it is ok for
<i>ucf</i> to use an already running debconf instance for
prompting (it has always been ok to use ucf when debconf is
not running -- it shall invoke debconf as needed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--debconf-template
foo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instruct ucf to use the named
multiselect debconf template instead of the normal
ucf-provided debconf template. The caller is responsible for
ensuring that the named template exists and has a list of
choices matching those for the default ucf template, and
should set Choices-C: ${CHOICES} to ensure the returned
values match those from the default template. Note that the
choices must be different according to whether the
<b>--three-way</b> option is also set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--state-dir
/path/to/dir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the state directory to
/path/to/dir instead of the default <i>/var/lib/ucf.</i>
Used mostly for testing.</p>

<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The most common
case usage is pretty simple: a single line invocation in the
postinst on configure, and another single line in the postrm
to tell <b>ucf</b> to forget about the configuration file on
purge (using the --purge option) is all that is needed
(assuming ucf is still on the system).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
recommended that you also register any file being managed by
<b>ucf</b> with the ucf registry; this associates the
configuration file with the package it belongs to. This is
done with a simple call to <b>ucfr.</b> Users may then query
the association between a configuration file and the package
using the tool <b>ucfq.</b> Please see the appropriate
manual pages for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a file
maintained by maintainer scripts is being transitioned from
an unprotected status to the protection afforded by the
script, the maintainer can help ease the transition by
reducing the questions that may be asked at installation
time. Specifically, questions should not be asked if the
file in question is an unmodified version that was one
shipped in a previous version of this package; and the
maintainer can help by telling the script about the
historical md5sums that published versions of this file
contained.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The way to do
this is to either create a file called <b>&lt;New
file&gt;.md5sum,</b> with one md5sum on each line, (the file
names you use are ignored, except for the entry named
default), or create a directory, called <b>&lt;New
file&gt;.md5sum.d,</b> which should contain any number of
files, each containing a single line, namely, the md5sum of
a previous version of <b>&lt;New file&gt;.</b> The names of
these files are not important, with one exception: The file
called default is treated specially. For example, the author
personally uses either package version numbers or release
code names, like <i>7.6.3,</i> or <i>potato.</i> If none of
the historical md5sums match, we are almost certain that
either the historical record of md5sums is not complete, or
the user has changed the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The default
historical md5sum</b> <br>
The exception to the rule about names mentioned earlier is
that if no md5sums match, and if the file <b>&lt;New
file&gt;.md5sum.d/default</b> exists, or if there is a line
corresponding to a <i>default</i> file in <b>&lt;New
file&gt;.md5sum,</b> it shall be used as the default md5sum
of the <i>previous</i> version of the package assumed to
have been installed on this machine. As you can see, unless
there are limited number of previously released packages
(like just one), the maintainer is also making an informed
guess, but the option is provided to the maintainer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the file
<b>&lt;New file&gt;.md5sum,</b> or the directory <b>&lt;New
file&gt;.md5sum.d</b> does not exist, or none of the md5sums
match, we test the installed <i>&lt;Destination&gt;</i> file
to see whether it is the same as the <i>&lt;New
file&gt;.</i> If not, we ask the user whether they want us
to replace the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An additional
facility is also offered: optionally, ucf can store one old
version of the maintainers copy of the configuration file,
and, on upgrade, calculate the changes made in the
maintainers version of the configuration file, and apply
that patch to the local version of the file (on user
request, of course). There is also a preview facility where
the user can inspect the results of such a merge, before
asking the action to be taken.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<a name="ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The variable
<b>UCF_FORCE_CONFFNEW,</b> if set, forces the new file to
always overwrite the installed destination file, while the
variable <b>UCF_FORCE_CONFFOLD,</b> if set silently retains
the installed file. <b>UCF_FORCE_CONFFMISS</b> is only
applicable when the installed destination file does not
exist (perhaps due to user removal),and forces ucf to
recreate the missing file (the default behaviour is to honor
the users wishes and not recreate the locally deleted file).
Additionally, when ucf creates an inferior shell, it
populates the variables <b>UCF_CONFFILE_NEW</b> and
<b>UCF_CONFFILE_OLD</b> which are useful for inspecting the
changes.</p>

<h2>FILES
<a name="FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This script
creates the file <i>new_file.md5sum,</i> and it may copy the
file (presumably shipped with the package) <i>&lt;New
file&gt;</i> to its destination,
<i>&lt;Destination&gt;.</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>/var/lib/ucf/hashfile,</i>
and <i>/var/lib/ucf/hashfile.X,</i> where <i>X</i> is a
small integer, where previous versions of the hashfile are
stored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>/etc/ucf.conf</i></p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the package
<i>foo</i> wants to use ucf to handle user interaction for
configuration file <i>foo.conf,</i> a version of which is
provided in the package as
<i>/usr/share/foo/configuration,</i> a simple invocation of
ucf in the post inst file is all that is needed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ucf</b>
<i>/usr/share/foo/configuration /etc/foo.conf</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On purge, one
should tell ucf to forget about the file (see detailed
examples in /usr/share/doc/ucf/examples):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ucf</b>
<i>--purge /etc/foo.conf</i> Please note that purge can also
be used to make ucf forget the previous state of the files,
and when the package is next installed or updated, ucf will
ask the user to replace the current cofiguration file. Do
this if you want to change your decision to not update to a
maintainer provided version of the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The motivation
for this script was to provide conffile like handling for
start files for emacs lisp packages (for example,
<i>/etc/emacs21/site-start.d/50psgml-init.el</i> ) These
start files are not shipped with the package, instead, they
are installed during the post installation configuration
phase by the script
<i>/usr/lib/emacsen-common/emacs-package-install
$package_name.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This script is
meant to be invoked by the packages install script at
<i>/usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/install/$package_name</i>
for each flavour of installed emacsen by calling it with the
proper values of new file (
<i>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/&lt;pkg&gt;/&lt;pkg-init.el</i>
), and dest file (
<i>/etc/emacs21/site-start.d/50&lt;pkg-init.el</i> ), and it
should do the rest.</p>
