<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reads list of
objects from the standard input, and writes either one or
more packed archives with the specified base-name to disk,
or a packed archive to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A packed
archive is an efficient way to transfer a set of objects
between two repositories as well as an access efficient
archival format. In a packed archive, an object is either
stored as a compressed whole or as a difference from some
other object. The latter is often called a delta.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The packed
archive format (.pack) is designed to be self-contained so
that it can be unpacked without any further information.
Therefore, each object that a delta depends upon must be
present within the pack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A pack index
file (.idx) is generated for fast, random access to the
objects in the pack. Placing both the index file (.idx) and
the packed archive (.pack) in the pack/ subdirectory of
$GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY (or any of the directories on
$GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES) enables Git to read from
the pack archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>git
unpack-objects</i> command can read the packed archive and
expand the objects contained in the pack into &quot;one-file
one-object&quot; format; this is typically done by the
smart-pull commands when a pack is created on-the-fly for
efficient network transport by their peers.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">base-name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write into pairs of files
(.pack and .idx), using &lt;base-name&gt; to determine the
name of the created file. When this option is used, the two
files in a pair are written in
&lt;base-name&gt;-&lt;SHA-1&gt;.{pack,idx} files.
&lt;SHA-1&gt; is a hash based on the pack content and is
written to the standard output of the command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--stdout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write the pack contents (what
would have been written to .pack file) out to the standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--revs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Read the revision arguments
from the standard input, instead of individual object names.
The revision arguments are processed the same way as <i>git
rev-list</i> with the <b>--objects</b> flag uses its
<b>commit</b> arguments to build the list of objects it
outputs. The objects on the resulting list are packed.
Besides revisions, <b>--not</b> or <b>--shallow
&lt;SHA-1&gt;</b> lines are also accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--unpacked</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This implies <b>--revs</b>.
When processing the list of revision arguments read from the
standard input, limit the objects packed to those that are
not already packed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--all</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This implies <b>--revs</b>. In
addition to the list of revision arguments read from the
standard input, pretend as if all refs under <b>refs/</b>
are specified to be included.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--include-tag</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Include unasked-for annotated
tags if the object they reference was included in the
resulting packfile. This can be useful to send new tags to
native Git clients.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--stdin-packs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Read the basenames of packfiles
(e.g., <b>pack-1234abcd.pack</b>) from the standard input,
instead of object names or revision arguments. The resulting
pack contains all objects listed in the included packs
(those not beginning with <b>^</b>), excluding any objects
listed in the excluded packs (beginning with <b>^</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Incompatible
with <b>--revs</b>, or options that imply <b>--revs</b>
(such as <b>--all</b>), with the exception of
<b>--unpacked</b>, which is compatible.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--window=&lt;n&gt;,
--depth=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These two options affect how
the objects contained in the pack are stored using delta
compression. The objects are first internally sorted by
type, size and optionally names and compared against the
other objects within --window to see if using delta
compression saves space. --depth limits the maximum delta
depth; making it too deep affects the performance on the
unpacker side, because delta data needs to be applied that
many times to get to the necessary object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value for --window is 10 and --depth is 50. The maximum
depth is 4095.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--window-memory=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option provides an
additional limit on top of <b>--window</b>; the window size
will dynamically scale down so as to not take up more than
<i>&lt;n&gt;</i> bytes in memory. This is useful in
repositories with a mix of large and small objects to not
run out of memory with a large window, but still be able to
take advantage of the large window for the smaller objects.
The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;,
or &quot;g&quot;. <b>--window-memory=0</b> makes memory
usage unlimited. The default is taken from the
<b>pack.windowMemory</b> configuration variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--max-pack-size=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In unusual scenarios, you may
not be able to create files larger than a certain size on
your filesystem, and this option can be used to tell the
command to split the output packfile into multiple
independent packfiles, each not larger than the given size.
The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;,
or &quot;g&quot;. The minimum size allowed is limited to 1
MiB. The default is unlimited, unless the config variable
<b>pack.packSizeLimit</b> is set. Note that this option may
result in a larger and slower repository; see the discussion
in <b>pack.packSizeLimit</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--honor-pack-keep</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag causes an object
already in a local pack that has a .keep file to be ignored,
even if it would have otherwise been packed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--keep-pack=&lt;pack-name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag causes an object
already in the given pack to be ignored, even if it would
have otherwise been packed. <b>&lt;pack-name&gt;</b> is the
pack file name without leading directory (e.g.
<b>pack-123.pack</b>). The option could be specified
multiple times to keep multiple packs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--incremental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag causes an object
already in a pack to be ignored even if it would have
otherwise been packed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--local</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag causes an object that
is borrowed from an alternate object store to be ignored
even if it would have otherwise been packed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--non-empty</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only create a packed archive if
it would contain at least one object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--progress</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Progress status is reported on
the standard error stream by default when it is attached to
a terminal, unless -q is specified. This flag forces
progress status even if the standard error stream is not
directed to a terminal.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--all-progress</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When --stdout is specified then
progress report is displayed during the object count and
compression phases but inhibited during the write-out phase.
The reason is that in some cases the output stream is
directly linked to another command which may wish to display
progress status of its own as it processes incoming pack
data. This flag is like --progress except that it forces
progress report for the write-out phase as well even if
--stdout is used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--all-progress-implied</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is used to imply
--all-progress whenever progress display is activated.
Unlike --all-progress this flag doesn&rsquo;t actually force
any progress display by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-q</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag makes the command not
to report its progress on the standard error stream.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--no-reuse-delta</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When creating a packed archive
in a repository that has existing packs, the command reuses
existing deltas. This sometimes results in a slightly
suboptimal pack. This flag tells the command not to reuse
existing deltas but compute them from scratch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--no-reuse-object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag tells the command not
to reuse existing object data at all, including non
deltified object, forcing recompression of everything. This
implies --no-reuse-delta. Useful only in the obscure case
where wholesale enforcement of a different compression level
on the packed data is desired.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--compression=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies compression level for
newly-compressed data in the generated pack. If not
specified, pack compression level is determined first by
pack.compression, then by core.compression, and defaults to
-1, the zlib default, if neither is set. Add
--no-reuse-object if you want to force a uniform compression
level on all data no matter the source.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]sparse</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Toggle the &quot;sparse&quot;
algorithm to determine which objects to include in the pack,
when combined with the &quot;--revs&quot; option. This
algorithm only walks trees that appear in paths that
introduce new objects. This can have significant performance
benefits when computing a pack to send a small change.
However, it is possible that extra objects are added to the
pack-file if the included commits contain certain types of
direct renames. If this option is not included, it defaults
to the value of <b>pack.useSparse</b>, which is true unless
otherwise specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--thin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a &quot;thin&quot; pack
by omitting the common objects between a sender and a
receiver in order to reduce network transfer. This option
only makes sense in conjunction with --stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note: A thin
pack violates the packed archive format by omitting required
objects and is thus unusable by Git without making it
self-contained. Use <b>git index-pack --fix-thin</b> (see
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-index-pack">git-index-pack(1)</a>) to restore the self-contained
property.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--shallow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Optimize a pack that will be
provided to a client with a shallow repository. This option,
combined with --thin, can result in a smaller pack at the
cost of speed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--delta-base-offset</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A packed archive can express
the base object of a delta as either a 20-byte object name
or as an offset in the stream, but ancient versions of Git
don&rsquo;t understand the latter. By default, <i>git
pack-objects</i> only uses the former format for better
compatibility. This option allows the command to use the
latter format for compactness. Depending on the average
delta chain length, this option typically shrinks the
resulting packfile by 3-5 per-cent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note: Porcelain
commands such as <b>git gc</b> (see <a href="https://man.page/1/git-gc">git-gc(1)</a>),
<b>git repack</b> (see <a href="https://man.page/1/git-repack">git-repack(1)</a>) pass this
option by default in modern Git when they put objects in
your repository into pack files. So does <b>git bundle</b>
(see <a href="https://man.page/1/git-bundle">git-bundle(1)</a>) when it creates a bundle.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--threads=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the number of threads
to spawn when searching for best delta matches. This
requires that pack-objects be compiled with pthreads
otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This is
meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines. The
required amount of memory for the delta search window is
however multiplied by the number of threads. Specifying 0
will cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPU&rsquo;s and
set the number of threads accordingly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is intended to be used by
the test suite only. It allows to force the version for the
generated pack index, and to force 64-bit index entries on
objects located above the given offset.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--keep-true-parents</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With this option, parents that
are hidden by grafts are packed nevertheless.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--filter=&lt;filter-spec&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Requires <b>--stdout</b>. Omits
certain objects (usually blobs) from the resulting packfile.
See <a href="https://man.page/1/git-rev-list">git-rev-list(1)</a> for valid
<b>&lt;filter-spec&gt;</b> forms.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--no-filter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turns off any previous
<b>--filter=</b> argument.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--missing=&lt;missing-action&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A debug option to help with
future &quot;partial clone&quot; development. This option
specifies how missing objects are handled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The form
<i>--missing=error</i> requests that pack-objects stop with
an error if a missing object is encountered. If the
repository is a partial clone, an attempt to fetch missing
objects will be made before declaring them missing. This is
the default action.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The form
<i>--missing=allow-any</i> will allow object traversal to
continue if a missing object is encountered. No fetch of a
missing object will occur. Missing objects will silently be
omitted from the results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The form
<i>--missing=allow-promisor</i> is like <i>allow-any</i>,
but will only allow object traversal to continue for
EXPECTED promisor missing objects. No fetch of a missing
object will occur. An unexpected missing object will raise
an error.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--exclude-promisor-objects</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Omit objects that are known to
be in the promisor remote. (This option has the purpose of
operating only on locally created objects, so that when we
repack, we still maintain a distinction between locally
created objects [without .promisor] and objects from the
promisor remote [with .promisor].) This is used with partial
clone.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--keep-unreachable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Objects unreachable from the
refs in packs named with --unpacked= option are added to the
resulting pack, in addition to the reachable objects that
are not in packs marked with *.keep files. This implies
<b>--revs</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--pack-loose-unreachable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pack unreachable loose objects
(and their loose counterparts removed). This implies
<b>--revs</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--unpack-unreachable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Keep unreachable objects in
loose form. This implies <b>--revs</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--delta-islands</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Restrict delta matches based on
&quot;islands&quot;. See DELTA ISLANDS below.</p>

<h2>DELTA ISLANDS
<a name="DELTA ISLANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When possible,
<b>pack-objects</b> tries to reuse existing on-disk deltas
to avoid having to search for new ones on the fly. This is
an important optimization for serving fetches, because it
means the server can avoid inflating most objects at all and
just send the bytes directly from disk. This optimization
can&rsquo;t work when an object is stored as a delta against
a base which the receiver does not have (and which we are
not already sending). In that case the server
&quot;breaks&quot; the delta and has to find a new one,
which has a high CPU cost. Therefore it&rsquo;s important
for performance that the set of objects in on-disk delta
relationships match what a client would fetch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a normal
repository, this tends to work automatically. The objects
are mostly reachable from the branches and tags, and
that&rsquo;s what clients fetch. Any deltas we find on the
server are likely to be between objects the client has or
will have.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But in some
repository setups, you may have several related but separate
groups of ref tips, with clients tending to fetch those
groups independently. For example, imagine that you are
hosting several &quot;forks&quot; of a repository in a
single shared object store, and letting clients view them as
separate repositories through <b>GIT_NAMESPACE</b> or
separate repos using the alternates mechanism. A naive
repack may find that the optimal delta for an object is
against a base that is only found in another fork. But when
a client fetches, they will not have the base object, and
we&rsquo;ll have to find a new delta on the fly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A similar
situation may exist if you have many refs outside of
<b>refs/heads/</b> and <b>refs/tags/</b> that point to
related objects (e.g., <b>refs/pull</b> or
<b>refs/changes</b> used by some hosting providers). By
default, clients fetch only heads and tags, and deltas
against objects found only in those other groups cannot be
sent as-is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Delta islands
solve this problem by allowing you to group your refs into
distinct &quot;islands&quot;. Pack-objects computes which
objects are reachable from which islands, and refuses to
make a delta from an object <b>A</b> against a base which is
not present in all of <b>A</b>'s islands. This results in
slightly larger packs (because we miss some delta
opportunities), but guarantees that a fetch of one island
will not have to recompute deltas on the fly due to crossing
island boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When repacking
with delta islands the delta window tends to get clogged
with candidates that are forbidden by the config. Repacking
with a big --window helps (and doesn&rsquo;t take as long as
it otherwise might because we can reject some object pairs
based on islands before doing any computation on the
content).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Islands are
configured via the <b>pack.island</b> option, which can be
specified multiple times. Each value is a left-anchored
regular expressions matching refnames. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[pack] <br>
island = refs/heads/ <br>
island = refs/tags/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">puts heads and
tags into an island (whose name is the empty string; see
below for more on naming). Any refs which do not match those
regular expressions (e.g., <b>refs/pull/123</b>) is not in
any island. Any object which is reachable only from
<b>refs/pull/</b> (but not heads or tags) is therefore not a
candidate to be used as a base for <b>refs/heads/</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Refs are
grouped into islands based on their &quot;names&quot;, and
two regexes that produce the same name are considered to be
in the same island. The names are computed from the regexes
by concatenating any capture groups from the regex, with a
<i>-</i> dash in between. (And if there are no capture
groups, then the name is the empty string, as in the above
example.) This allows you to create arbitrary numbers of
islands. Only up to 14 such capture groups are supported
though.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
imagine you store the refs for each fork in
<b>refs/virtual/ID</b>, where <b>ID</b> is a numeric
identifier. You might then configure:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[pack] <br>
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/heads/ <br>
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/tags/ <br>
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/(pull)/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That puts the
heads and tags for each fork in their own island (named
&quot;1234&quot; or similar), and the pull refs for each go
into their own &quot;1234-pull&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that we
pick a single island for each regex to go into, using
&quot;last one wins&quot; ordering (which allows
repo-specific config to take precedence over user-wide
config, and so forth).</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various
configuration variables affect packing, see

&quot;delta&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Notably, delta
compression is not used on objects larger than the
<b>core.bigFileThreshold</b> configuration variable and on
files with the attribute <b>delta</b> set to false.</p>
