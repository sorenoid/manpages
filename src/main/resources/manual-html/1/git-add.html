<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
updates the index using the current content found in the
working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next
commit. It typically adds the current content of existing
paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used
to add content with only part of the changes made to the
working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not
exist in the working tree anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;index&quot; holds a snapshot of the content of the
working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the
contents of the next commit. Thus after making any changes
to the working tree, and before running the commit command,
you must use the <b>add</b> command to add any new or
modified files to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only
adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the
add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included
in the next commit, then you must run <b>git add</b> again
to add the new content to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>git
status</b> command can be used to obtain a summary of which
files have changes that are staged for the next commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>git
add</b> command will not add ignored files by default. If
any ignored files were explicitly specified on the command
line, <b>git add</b> will fail with a list of ignored files.
Ignored files reached by directory recursion or filename
globbing performed by Git (quote your globs before the
shell) will be silently ignored. The <i>git add</i> command
can be used to add ignored files with the <b>-f</b> (force)
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please see
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-commit">git-commit(1)</a> for alternative ways to add content to
a commit.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;pathspec&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Files to add content from.
Fileglobs (e.g. <b>*.c</b>) can be given to add all matching
files. Also a leading directory name (e.g. <b>dir</b> to add
<b>dir/file1</b> and <b>dir/file2</b>) can be given to
update the index to match the current state of the directory
as a whole (e.g. specifying <b>dir</b> will record not just
a file <b>dir/file1</b> modified in the working tree, a file
<b>dir/file2</b> added to the working tree, but also a file
<b>dir/file3</b> removed from the working tree). Note that
older versions of Git used to ignore removed files; use
<b>--no-all</b> option if you want to add modified or new
files but ignore removed ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For more
details about the &lt;pathspec&gt; syntax, see the
<i>pathspec</i> entry in <a href="https://man.page/7/gitglossary">gitglossary(7)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-n,
--dry-run</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t actually add the
file(s), just show if they exist and/or will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-v,
--verbose</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-f, --force</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow adding otherwise ignored
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--sparse</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow updating index entries
outside of the sparse-checkout cone. Normally, <b>git
add</b> refuses to update index entries whose paths do not
fit within the sparse-checkout cone, since those files might
be removed from the working tree without warning. See
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-sparse-checkout">git-sparse-checkout(1)</a> for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-i,
--interactive</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add modified contents in the
working tree interactively to the index. Optional path
arguments may be supplied to limit operation to a subset of
the working tree. See &ldquo;Interactive mode&rdquo; for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-p, --patch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Interactively choose hunks of
patch between the index and the work tree and add them to
the index. This gives the user a chance to review the
difference before adding modified contents to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This
effectively runs <b>add --interactive</b>, but bypasses the
initial command menu and directly jumps to the <b>patch</b>
subcommand. See &ldquo;Interactive mode&rdquo; for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Open the diff vs. the index in
an editor and let the user edit it. After the editor was
closed, adjust the hunk headers and apply the patch to the
index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The intent of
this option is to pick and choose lines of the patch to
apply, or even to modify the contents of lines to be staged.
This can be quicker and more flexible than using the
interactive hunk selector. However, it is easy to confuse
oneself and create a patch that does not apply to the index.
See EDITING PATCHES below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-u,
--update</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Update the index just where it
already has an entry matching &lt;pathspec&gt;. This removes
as well as modifies index entries to match the working tree,
but adds no new files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If no
&lt;pathspec&gt; is given when <b>-u</b> option is used, all
tracked files in the entire working tree are updated (old
versions of Git used to limit the update to the current
directory and its subdirectories).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-A, --all,
--no-ignore-removal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Update the index not only where
the working tree has a file matching &lt;pathspec&gt; but
also where the index already has an entry. This adds,
modifies, and removes index entries to match the working
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If no
&lt;pathspec&gt; is given when <b>-A</b> option is used, all
files in the entire working tree are updated (old versions
of Git used to limit the update to the current directory and
its subdirectories).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--no-all,
--ignore-removal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Update the index by adding new
files that are unknown to the index and files modified in
the working tree, but ignore files that have been removed
from the working tree. This option is a no-op when no
&lt;pathspec&gt; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
primarily to help users who are used to older versions of
Git, whose &quot;git add &lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot; was a
synonym for &quot;git add --no-all
&lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot;, i.e. ignored removed files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-N,
--intent-to-add</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Record only the fact that the
path will be added later. An entry for the path is placed in
the index with no content. This is useful for, among other
things, showing the unstaged content of such files with
<b>git diff</b> and committing them with <b>git commit
-a</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--refresh</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t add the file(s),
but only refresh their stat() information in the index.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--ignore-errors</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If some files could not be
added because of errors indexing them, do not abort the
operation, but continue adding the others. The command shall
still exit with non-zero status. The configuration variable
<b>add.ignoreErrors</b> can be set to true to make this the
default behaviour.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--ignore-missing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option can only be used
together with --dry-run. By using this option the user can
check if any of the given files would be ignored, no matter
if they are already present in the work tree or not.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--no-warn-embedded-repo</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, <b>git add</b> will
warn when adding an embedded repository to the index without
using <b>git submodule add</b> to create an entry in
<b>.gitmodules</b>. This option will suppress the warning
(e.g., if you are manually performing operations on
submodules).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--renormalize</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply the &quot;clean&quot;
process freshly to all tracked files to forcibly add them
again to the index. This is useful after changing
<b>core.autocrlf</b> configuration or the <b>text</b>
attribute in order to correct files added with wrong CRLF/LF
line endings. This option implies <b>-u</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--chmod=(+|-)x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Override the executable bit of
the added files. The executable bit is only changed in the
index, the files on disk are left unchanged.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pathspec is passed in
<b>&lt;file&gt;</b> instead of commandline args. If
<b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is exactly <b>-</b> then standard input
is used. Pathspec elements are separated by LF or CR/LF.
Pathspec elements can be quoted as explained for the
configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b> (see
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-config">git-config(1)</a>). See also <b>--pathspec-file-nul</b>
and global <b>--literal-pathspecs</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--pathspec-file-nul</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only meaningful with
<b>--pathspec-from-file</b>. Pathspec elements are separated
with NUL character and all other characters are taken
literally (including newlines and quotes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option can be used to
separate command-line options from the list of files,
(useful when filenames might be mistaken for command-line
options).</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Adds
content from all <b>*.txt</b> files under
<b>Documentation</b> directory and its subdirectories:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git add
Documentation/\*.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
asterisk <b>*</b> is quoted from the shell in this example;
this lets the command include the files from subdirectories
of <b>Documentation/</b> directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Considers adding content from all git-*.sh scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git add
git-*.sh</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because this
example lets the shell expand the asterisk (i.e. you are
listing the files explicitly), it does not consider
<b>subdir/git-foo.sh</b>.</p>

<h2>INTERACTIVE MODE
<a name="INTERACTIVE MODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
command enters the interactive mode, it shows the output of
the <i>status</i> subcommand, and then goes into its
interactive command loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
loop shows the list of subcommands available, and gives a
prompt &quot;What now&gt; &quot;. In general, when the
prompt ends with a single <i>&gt;</i>, you can pick only one
of the choices given and type return, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">*** Commands
*** <br>
1: status 2: update 3: revert 4: add untracked <br>
5: patch 6: diff 7: quit 8: help <br>
What now&gt; 1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You also could
say <b>s</b> or <b>sta</b> or <b>status</b> above as long as
the choice is unique.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
command loop has 6 subcommands (plus help and quit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">status</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This shows the change between
HEAD and index (i.e. what will be committed if you say
<b>git commit</b>), and between index and working tree files
(i.e. what you could stage further before <b>git commit</b>
using <b>git add</b>) for each path. A sample output looks
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">staged unstaged
path <br>
1: binary nothing foo.png <br>
2: +403/-35 +1/-1 git-add--interactive.perl</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It shows that
foo.png has differences from HEAD (but that is binary so
line count cannot be shown) and there is no difference
between indexed copy and the working tree version (if the
working tree version were also different, <i>binary</i>
would have been shown in place of <i>nothing</i>). The other
file, git-add--interactive.perl, has 403 lines added and 35
lines deleted if you commit what is in the index, but
working tree file has further modifications (one addition
and one deletion).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">update</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This shows the status
information and issues an &quot;Update&gt;&gt;&quot; prompt.
When the prompt ends with double <i>&gt;&gt;</i>, you can
make more than one selection, concatenated with whitespace
or comma. Also you can say ranges. E.g. &quot;2-5 7,9&quot;
to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from the list. If the second number in
a range is omitted, all remaining patches are taken. E.g.
&quot;7-&quot; to choose 7,8,9 from the list. You can say
<i>*</i> to choose everything.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">What you chose
are then highlighted with <i>*</i>, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">staged unstaged
path <br>
1: binary nothing foo.png <br>
* 2: +403/-35 +1/-1 git-add--interactive.perl</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To remove
selection, prefix the input with <b>-</b> like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Update&gt;&gt;
-2</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">After making
the selection, answer with an empty line to stage the
contents of working tree files for selected paths in the
index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">revert</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This has a very similar UI to
<i>update</i>, and the staged information for selected paths
are reverted to that of the HEAD version. Reverting new
paths makes them untracked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">add
untracked</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This has a very similar UI to
<i>update</i> and <i>revert</i>, and lets you add untracked
paths to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">patch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This lets you choose one path
out of a <i>status</i> like selection. After choosing the
path, it presents the diff between the index and the working
tree file and asks you if you want to stage the change of
each hunk. You can select one of the following options and
type return:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">y - stage this
hunk <br>
n - do not stage this hunk <br>
q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining
ones <br>
a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file <br>
d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the
file <br>
g - select a hunk to go to <br>
/ - search for a hunk matching the given regex <br>
j - leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk <br>
J - leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk <br>
k - leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
<br>
K - leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk <br>
s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks <br>
e - manually edit the current hunk <br>
? - print help</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">After deciding
the fate for all hunks, if there is any hunk that was
chosen, the index is updated with the selected hunks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can omit
having to type return here, by setting the configuration
variable <b>interactive.singleKey</b> to <b>true</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">diff</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This lets you review what will
be committed (i.e. between HEAD and index).</p>

<h2>EDITING PATCHES
<a name="EDITING PATCHES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Invoking <b>git
add -e</b> or selecting <b>e</b> from the interactive hunk
selector will open a patch in your editor; after the editor
exits, the result is applied to the index. You are free to
make arbitrary changes to the patch, but note that some
changes may have confusing results, or even result in a
patch that cannot be applied. If you want to abort the
operation entirely (i.e., stage nothing new in the index),
simply delete all lines of the patch. The list below
describes some common things you may see in a patch, and
which editing operations make sense on them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">added
content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Added content is represented by
lines beginning with &quot;+&quot;. You can prevent staging
any addition lines by deleting them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">removed
content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Removed content is represented
by lines beginning with &quot;-&quot;. You can prevent
staging their removal by converting the &quot;-&quot; to a
&quot; &quot; (space).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">modified
content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Modified content is represented
by &quot;-&quot; lines (removing the old content) followed
by &quot;+&quot; lines (adding the replacement content). You
can prevent staging the modification by converting
&quot;-&quot; lines to &quot; &quot;, and removing
&quot;+&quot; lines. Beware that modifying only half of the
pair is likely to introduce confusing changes to the
index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
more complex operations that can be performed. But beware
that because the patch is applied only to the index and not
the working tree, the working tree will appear to
&quot;undo&quot; the change in the index. For example,
introducing a new line into the index that is in neither the
HEAD nor the working tree will stage the new line for
commit, but the line will appear to be reverted in the
working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Avoid using
these constructs, or do so with extreme caution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">removing
untouched content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Content which does not differ
between the index and working tree may be shown on context
lines, beginning with a &quot; &quot; (space). You can stage
context lines for removal by converting the space to a
&quot;-&quot;. The resulting working tree file will appear
to re-add the content.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">modifying
existing content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One can also modify context
lines by staging them for removal (by converting &quot;
&quot; to &quot;-&quot;) and adding a &quot;+&quot; line
with the new content. Similarly, one can modify
&quot;+&quot; lines for existing additions or modifications.
In all cases, the new modification will appear reverted in
the working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">new content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">You may also add new content
that does not exist in the patch; simply add new lines, each
starting with &quot;+&quot;. The addition will appear
reverted in the working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
several operations which should be avoided entirely, as they
will make the patch impossible to apply:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; adding
context (&quot; &quot;) or removal (&quot;-&quot;) lines</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; deleting
context or removal lines</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
modifying the contents of context or removal lines</p>
