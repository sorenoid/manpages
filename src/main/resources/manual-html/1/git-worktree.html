<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Manage multiple
working trees attached to the same repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A git
repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you
to check out more than one branch at a time. With <b>git
worktree add</b> a new working tree is associated with the
repository. This new working tree is called a &quot;linked
working tree&quot; as opposed to the &quot;main working
tree&quot; prepared by <a href="https://man.page/1/git-init">git-init(1)</a> or
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-clone">git-clone(1)</a>. A repository has one main working tree
(if it&rsquo;s not a bare repository) and zero or more
linked working trees. When you are done with a linked
working tree, remove it with <b>git worktree remove</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In its simplest
form, <b>git worktree add &lt;path&gt;</b> automatically
creates a new branch whose name is the final component of
<b>&lt;path&gt;</b>, which is convenient if you plan to work
on a new topic. For instance, <b>git worktree add
../hotfix</b> creates new branch <b>hotfix</b> and checks it
out at path <b>../hotfix</b>. To instead work on an existing
branch in a new working tree, use <b>git worktree add
&lt;path&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</b>. On the other hand, if you
just plan to make some experimental changes or do testing
without disturbing existing development, it is often
convenient to create a <i>throwaway</i> working tree not
associated with any branch. For instance, <b>git worktree
add -d &lt;path&gt;</b> creates a new working tree with a
detached <b>HEAD</b> at the same commit as the current
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a working
tree is deleted without using <b>git worktree remove</b>,
then its associated administrative files, which reside in
the repository (see &quot;DETAILS&quot; below), will
eventually be removed automatically (see
<b>gc.worktreePruneExpire</b> in <a href="https://man.page/1/git-config">git-config(1)</a>), or
you can run <b>git worktree prune</b> in the main or any
linked working tree to clean up any stale administrative
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a linked
working tree is stored on a portable device or network share
which is not always mounted, you can prevent its
administrative files from being pruned by issuing the <b>git
worktree lock</b> command, optionally specifying
<b>--reason</b> to explain why the working tree is
locked.</p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">add
&lt;path&gt; [&lt;commit-ish&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> and
checkout <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> into it. The new working
directory is linked to the current repository, sharing
everything except working directory specific files such as
<b>HEAD</b>, <b>index</b>, etc. As a convenience,
<b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> may be a bare
&quot;<b>-</b>&quot;, which is synonymous with
<b>@{-1}</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> is a branch name (call it
<b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>) and is not found, and neither
<b>-b</b> nor <b>-B</b> nor <b>--detach</b> are used, but
there does exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote
(call it <b>&lt;remote&gt;</b>) with a matching name, treat
as equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree
add --track -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;path&gt;
&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the branch
exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named by the
<b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> configuration variable,
we&rsquo;ll use that one for the purposes of disambiguation,
even if the <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> isn&rsquo;t unique across
all remotes. Set it to e.g.
<b>checkout.defaultRemote=origin</b> to always checkout
remote branches from there if <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> is
ambiguous but exists on the <b>origin</b> remote. See also
<b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> in <a href="https://man.page/1/git-config">git-config(1)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> is omitted and neither <b>-b</b>
nor <b>-B</b> nor <b>--detach</b> used, then, as a
convenience, the new working tree is associated with a
branch (call it <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>) named after
<b>$(basename &lt;path&gt;)</b>. If <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>
doesn&rsquo;t exist, a new branch based on <b>HEAD</b> is
automatically created as if <b>-b &lt;branch&gt;</b> was
given. If <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> does exist, it will be
checked out in the new working tree, if it&rsquo;s not
checked out anywhere else, otherwise the command will refuse
to create the working tree (unless <b>--force</b> is
used).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List details of each working
tree. The main working tree is listed first, followed by
each of the linked working trees. The output details include
whether the working tree is bare, the revision currently
checked out, the branch currently checked out (or
&quot;detached HEAD&quot; if none), &quot;locked&quot; if
the worktree is locked, &quot;prunable&quot; if the worktree
can be pruned by <b>prune</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">lock</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a working tree is on a
portable device or network share which is not always
mounted, lock it to prevent its administrative files from
being pruned automatically. This also prevents it from being
moved or deleted. Optionally, specify a reason for the lock
with <b>--reason</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">move</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Move a working tree to a new
location. Note that the main working tree or linked working
trees containing submodules cannot be moved with this
command. (The <b>git worktree repair</b> command, however,
can reestablish the connection with linked working trees if
you move the main working tree manually.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prune</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prune working tree information
in <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">remove</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove a working tree. Only
clean working trees (no untracked files and no modification
in tracked files) can be removed. Unclean working trees or
ones with submodules can be removed with <b>--force</b>. The
main working tree cannot be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">repair
[&lt;path&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Repair working tree
administrative files, if possible, if they have become
corrupted or outdated due to external factors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For instance,
if the main working tree (or bare repository) is moved,
linked working trees will be unable to locate it. Running
<b>repair</b> in the main working tree will reestablish the
connection from linked working trees back to the main
working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, if a
linked working tree is moved without using <b>git worktree
move</b>, the main working tree (or bare repository) will be
unable to locate it. Running <b>repair</b> within the
recently-moved working tree will reestablish the connection.
If multiple linked working trees are moved, running
<b>repair</b> from any working tree with each tree&rsquo;s
new <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> as an argument, will reestablish the
connection to all the specified paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If both the
main working tree and linked working trees have been moved
manually, then running <b>repair</b> in the main working
tree and specifying the new <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> of each
linked working tree will reestablish all connections in both
directions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">unlock</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Unlock a working tree, allowing
it to be pruned, moved or deleted.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-f, --force</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, <b>add</b> refuses
to create a new working tree when <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b>
is a branch name and is already checked out by another
working tree, or if <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> is already assigned
to some working tree but is missing (for instance, if
<b>&lt;path&gt;</b> was deleted manually). This option
overrides these safeguards. To add a missing but locked
working tree path, specify <b>--force</b> twice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>move</b>
refuses to move a locked working tree unless <b>--force</b>
is specified twice. If the destination is already assigned
to some other working tree but is missing (for instance, if
<b>&lt;new-path&gt;</b> was deleted manually), then
<b>--force</b> allows the move to proceed; use
<b>--force</b> twice if the destination is locked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>remove</b>
refuses to remove an unclean working tree unless
<b>--force</b> is used. To remove a locked working tree,
specify <b>--force</b> twice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-b
&lt;new-branch&gt;, -B &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>add</b>, create a new
branch named <b>&lt;new-branch&gt;</b> starting at
<b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b>, and check out
<b>&lt;new-branch&gt;</b> into the new working tree. If
<b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> is omitted, it defaults to
<b>HEAD</b>. By default, <b>-b</b> refuses to create a new
branch if it already exists. <b>-B</b> overrides this
safeguard, resetting <b>&lt;new-branch&gt;</b> to
<b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-d,
--detach</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>add</b>, detach
<b>HEAD</b> in the new working tree. See &quot;DETACHED
HEAD&quot; in <a href="https://man.page/1/git-checkout">git-checkout(1)</a>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]checkout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, <b>add</b> checks
out <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b>, however, <b>--no-checkout</b>
can be used to suppress checkout in order to make
customizations, such as configuring sparse-checkout. See
&quot;Sparse checkout&quot; in <a href="https://man.page/1/git-read-tree">git-read-tree(1)</a>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]guess-remote</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>worktree add
&lt;path&gt;</b>, without <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b>, instead
of creating a new branch from <b>HEAD</b>, if there exists a
tracking branch in exactly one remote matching the basename
of <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>, base the new branch on the
remote-tracking branch, and mark the remote-tracking branch
as &quot;upstream&quot; from the new branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This can also
be set up as the default behaviour by using the
<b>worktree.guessRemote</b> config option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]track</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When creating a new branch, if
<b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> is a branch, mark it as
&quot;upstream&quot; from the new branch. This is the
default if <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> is a remote-tracking
branch. See <b>--track</b> in <a href="https://man.page/1/git-branch">git-branch(1)</a> for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--lock</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Keep the working tree locked
after creation. This is the equivalent of <b>git worktree
lock</b> after <b>git worktree add</b>, but without a race
condition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-n,
--dry-run</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>prune</b>, do not
remove anything; just report what it would remove.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--porcelain</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>list</b>, output in an
easy-to-parse format for scripts. This format will remain
stable across Git versions and regardless of user
configuration. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>add</b>, suppress
feedback messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-v,
--verbose</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>prune</b>, report all
removals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>list</b>, output additional information about worktrees
(see below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--expire
&lt;time&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>prune</b>, only expire
unused working trees older than <b>&lt;time&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>list</b>, annotate missing working trees as prunable if
they are older than <b>&lt;time&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--reason
&lt;string&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>lock</b> or with <b>add
--lock</b>, an explanation why the working tree is
locked.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;worktree&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Working trees can be identified
by path, either relative or absolute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the last
path components in the working tree&rsquo;s path is unique
among working trees, it can be used to identify a working
tree. For example if you only have two working trees, at
<b>/abc/def/ghi</b> and <b>/abc/def/ggg</b>, then <b>ghi</b>
or <b>def/ghi</b> is enough to point to the former working
tree.</p>

<h2>REFS
<a name="REFS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In multiple
working trees, some refs may be shared between all working
trees and some refs are local. One example is <b>HEAD</b>
which is different for each working tree. This section is
about the sharing rules and how to access refs of one
working tree from another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general, all
pseudo refs are per working tree and all refs starting with
<b>refs/</b> are shared. Pseudo refs are ones like
<b>HEAD</b> which are directly under <b>$GIT_DIR</b> instead
of inside <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b>. There are exceptions,
however: refs inside <b>refs/bisect</b> and
<b>refs/worktree</b> are not shared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Refs that are
per working tree can still be accessed from another working
tree via two special paths, <b>main-worktree</b> and
<b>worktrees</b>. The former gives access to per-working
tree refs of the main working tree, while the latter to all
linked working trees.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
<b>main-worktree/HEAD</b> or
<b>main-worktree/refs/bisect/good</b> resolve to the same
value as the main working tree&rsquo;s <b>HEAD</b> and
<b>refs/bisect/good</b> respectively. Similarly,
<b>worktrees/foo/HEAD</b> or
<b>worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</b> are the same as
<b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/foo/HEAD</b> and
<b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To access refs,
it&rsquo;s best not to look inside <b>$GIT_DIR</b> directly.
Instead use commands such as <a href="https://man.page/1/git-rev-parse">git-rev-parse(1)</a> or
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-update-ref">git-update-ref(1)</a> which will handle refs
correctly.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION FILE
<a name="CONFIGURATION FILE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
repository <b>config</b> file is shared across all working
trees. If the config variables <b>core.bare</b> or
<b>core.worktree</b> are already present in the config file,
they will be applied to the main working trees only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
have configuration specific to working trees, you can turn
on the <b>worktreeConfig</b> extension, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git config
extensions.worktreeConfig true</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this mode,
specific configuration stays in the path pointed by <b>git
rev-parse --git-path config.worktree</b>. You can add or
update configuration in this file with <b>git config
--worktree</b>. Older Git versions will refuse to access
repositories with this extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
this file, the exception for <b>core.bare</b> and
<b>core.worktree</b> is gone. If they exist in
<b>$GIT_DIR/config</b>, you must move them to the
<b>config.worktree</b> of the main working tree. You may
also take this opportunity to review and move other
configuration that you do not want to share to all working
trees:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>core.worktree</b> and <b>core.bare</b> should never be
shared</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>core.sparseCheckout</b> is recommended per working tree,
unless you are sure you always use sparse checkout for all
working trees.</p>

<h2>DETAILS
<a name="DETAILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each linked
working tree has a private sub-directory in the
repository&rsquo;s <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> directory. The
private sub-directory&rsquo;s name is usually the base name
of the linked working tree&rsquo;s path, possibly appended
with a number to make it unique. For example, when
<b>$GIT_DIR=/path/main/.git</b> the command <b>git worktree
add /path/other/test-next next</b> creates the linked
working tree in <b>/path/other/test-next</b> and also
creates a <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next</b> directory (or
<b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next1</b> if <b>test-next</b> is
already taken).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within a linked
working tree, <b>$GIT_DIR</b> is set to point to this
private directory (e.g.
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</b> in the example)
and <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> is set to point back to the main
working tree&rsquo;s <b>$GIT_DIR</b> (e.g.
<b>/path/main/.git</b>). These settings are made in a
<b>.git</b> file located at the top directory of the linked
working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Path resolution
via <b>git rev-parse --git-path</b> uses either
<b>$GIT_DIR</b> or <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> depending on the
path. For example, in the linked working tree <b>git
rev-parse --git-path HEAD</b> returns
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/HEAD</b> (not
<b>/path/other/test-next/.git/HEAD</b> or
<b>/path/main/.git/HEAD</b>) while <b>git rev-parse
--git-path refs/heads/master</b> uses <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b>
and returns <b>/path/main/.git/refs/heads/master</b>, since
refs are shared across all working trees, except
<b>refs/bisect</b> and <b>refs/worktree</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<a href="https://man.page/5/gitrepository-layout">gitrepository-layout(5)</a> for more information. The
rule of thumb is do not make any assumption about whether a
path belongs to <b>$GIT_DIR</b> or <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b>
when you need to directly access something inside
<b>$GIT_DIR</b>. Use <b>git rev-parse --git-path</b> to get
the final path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you manually
move a linked working tree, you need to update the
<b>gitdir</b> file in the entry&rsquo;s directory. For
example, if a linked working tree is moved to
<b>/newpath/test-next</b> and its <b>.git</b> file points to
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</b>, then update
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/gitdir</b> to
reference <b>/newpath/test-next</b> instead. Better yet, run
<b>git worktree repair</b> to reestablish the connection
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To prevent a
<b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> entry from being pruned (which can
be useful in some situations, such as when the entry&rsquo;s
working tree is stored on a portable device), use the <b>git
worktree lock</b> command, which adds a file named
<b>locked</b> to the entry&rsquo;s directory. The file
contains the reason in plain text. For example, if a linked
working tree&rsquo;s <b>.git</b> file points to
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</b> then a file named
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/locked</b> will
prevent the <b>test-next</b> entry from being pruned. See
<a href="https://man.page/5/gitrepository-layout">gitrepository-layout(5)</a> for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> is enabled, the config file
<b>.git/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree</b> is read
after <b>.git/config</b> is.</p>

<h2>LIST OUTPUT FORMAT
<a name="LIST OUTPUT FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>worktree
list</b> command has two output formats. The default format
shows the details on a single line with columns. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree
list <br>
/path/to/bare-source (bare) <br>
/path/to/linked-worktree abcd1234 [master] <br>
/path/to/other-linked-worktree 1234abc (detached HEAD)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
also shows annotations for each working tree, according to
its state. These annotations are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>locked</b>, if the working tree is locked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>prunable</b>, if the working tree can be pruned via
<b>git worktree prune</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree
list <br>
/path/to/linked-worktree abcd1234 [master] <br>
/path/to/locked-worktree acbd5678 (brancha) locked <br>
/path/to/prunable-worktree 5678abc (detached HEAD)
prunable</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For these
annotations, a reason might also be available and this can
be seen using the verbose mode. The annotation is then moved
to the next line indented followed by the additional
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree
list --verbose <br>
/path/to/linked-worktree abcd1234 [master] <br>
/path/to/locked-worktree-no-reason abcd5678 (detached HEAD)

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Porcelain
Format</b> <br>
The porcelain format has a line per attribute. Attributes
are listed with a label and value separated by a single
space. Boolean attributes (like <b>bare</b> and
<b>detached</b>) are listed as a label only, and are present
only if the value is true. Some attributes (like
<b>locked</b>) can be listed as a label only or with a value
depending upon whether a reason is available. The first
attribute of a working tree is always <b>worktree</b>, an
empty line indicates the end of the record. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree
list --porcelain <br>
worktree /path/to/bare-source <br>
bare</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are in the
middle of a refactoring session and your boss comes in and
demands that you fix something immediately. You might
typically use <a href="https://man.page/1/git-stash">git-stash(1)</a> to store your changes away
temporarily, however, your working tree is in such a state
of disarray (with new, moved, and removed files, and other
bits and pieces strewn around) that you don&rsquo;t want to
risk disturbing any of it. Instead, you create a temporary
linked working tree to make the emergency fix, remove it
when done, and then resume your earlier refactoring
session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree
add -b emergency-fix ../temp master <br>
$ pushd ../temp <br>
# ... hack hack hack ... <br>
$ git commit -a -m 'emergency fix for boss' <br>
$ popd <br>
$ git worktree remove ../temp</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple
checkout in general is still experimental, and the support
for submodules is incomplete. It is NOT recommended to make
multiple checkouts of a superproject.</p>
