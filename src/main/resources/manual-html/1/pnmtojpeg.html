<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pnmtojpeg -
convert PNM image to a JFIF (&quot;JPEG&quot;) image</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmtojpeg</b>
[ <i>options</i> ] [ <i>filename</i> ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmtojpeg</b>
converts the named PBM, PGM, or PPM image file, or the
standard input if no file is named, to a JFIF file on the
standard output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmtojpeg</b>
uses the Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s JPEG library to
create the output file. See <b>http://www.ijg.org</b> for
information on the library.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;JFIF&quot;
is the correct name for the image format commonly known as
&quot;JPEG.&quot; Strictly speaking, JPEG is a method of
compression. The image format using JPEG compression that is
by far the most common is JFIF. There is also a subformat of
TIFF that uses JPEG compression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">EXIF is an
image format that is a subformat of JFIF (to wit, a JFIF
file that contains an EXIF header as an APP1 marker).
<b>pnmtojpeg</b> creates an EXIF image when you specify the
<b>-exif</b> option.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
options are: <b><br>
--exif=</b><i>filespec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies that the
output image is to be EXIF (a subformat of JFIF), i.e. it
will have an EXIF header as a JFIF APP1 marker. The contents
of that marker are the contents of the specified file. The
special value <b>-</b> means to read the EXIF header
contents from standard input. It is invalid to specify
standard input for both the EXIF header and the input
image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The EXIF file
starts with a two byte field which is the length of the
file, including the length field, in pure binary, most
significant byte first. The special value of zero for the
length field means there is to be no EXIF header, i.e. the
same as no <b>-exif</b> option. This is useful for when you
convert a file from JFIF to PNM using <b>jpegtopnm</b>, then
transform it, then convert it back to JFIF with
<b>pnmtojpeg</b>, and you don&rsquo;t know whether or not it
includes an EXIF header. <b>jpegtopnm</b> creates an EXIF
file containing nothing but two bytes of zero when the input
JFIF file has no EXIF header. Thus, you can transfer any
EXIF header from the input JFIF to the output JFIF without
worrying about whether an EXIF header actually exists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The contents of
the EXIF file after the length field are the exact byte for
byte contents of the APP1 marker, not counting the length
field, that constitutes the EXIF header.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--quality=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Scale quantization tables to
adjust image quality. <i>n</i> is 0 (worst) to 100 (best);
default is 75. (See below for more info.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--grayscale <br>
--greyscale</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create gray scale JFIF file.
With this option, <b>pnmtojpeg</b> converts color input to
gray scale. If you don&rsquo;t specify this option, The
output file is in color format if the input is PPM, and
grayscale format if the input is PBM or PGM.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In the PPM
input case, even if all the colors in the image are gray,
the output is in color format. Of course, the colors in it
are still gray. The difference is that color format takes up
a lot more space and takes longer to create and process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--optimize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Perform optimization of entropy
encoding parameters. Without this, <b>pnmtojpeg</b> uses
default encoding parameters. <b>--optimize</b> usually makes
the JFIF file a little smaller, but <b>pnmtojpeg</b> runs
somewhat slower and needs much more memory. Image quality
and speed of decompression are unaffected by
<b>--optimize</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--progressive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create a progressive JPEG file
(see below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--comment=</b><i>text</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Include a comment marker in the
JFIF output, with comment text <i>text</i>. Without this
option, there are no comment markers in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>--quality</b> option lets you trade off compressed file
size against quality of the reconstructed image: the higher
the quality setting, the larger the JFIF file, and the
closer the output image will be to the original input.
Normally you want to use the lowest quality setting
(smallest file) that decompresses into something visually
indistinguishable from the original image. For this purpose
the quality setting should be between 50 and 95; the default
of 75 is often about right. If you see defects at
<b>--quality=75</b>, then go up 5 or 10 counts at a time
until you are happy with the output image. (The optimal
setting will vary from one image to another.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--quality=100</b>
generates a quantization table of all 1&rsquo;s, minimizing
loss in the quantization step (but there is still
information loss in subsampling, as well as roundoff error).
This setting is mainly of interest for experimental
purposes. Quality values above about 95 are <i>not</i>
recommended for normal use; the compressed file size goes up
dramatically for hardly any gain in output image
quality.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the other
direction, quality values below 50 will produce very small
files of low image quality. Settings around 5 to 10 might be
useful in preparing an index of a large image library, for
example. Try <b>--quality=2</b> (or so) for some amusing
Cubist effects. (Note: quality values below about 25
generate 2-byte quantization tables, which are considered
optional in the JFIF standard. <b>pnmtojpeg</b> emits a
warning message when you give such a quality value, because
some other JFIF programs may be unable to decode the
resulting file. Use <b>--baseline</b> if you need to ensure
compatibility at low quality values.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>--progressive</b> option creates a &quot;progressive
JPEG&quot; file. In this type of JFIF file, the data is
stored in multiple scans of increasing quality. If the file
is being transmitted over a slow communications link, the
decoder can use the first scan to display a low-quality
image very quickly, and can then improve the display with
each subsequent scan. The final image is exactly equivalent
to a standard JFIF file of the same quality setting, and the
total file size is about the same -- often a little smaller.
<b>Caution:</b> progressive JPEG is not yet widely
implemented, so many decoders will be unable to view a
progressive JPEG file at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Options for
advanced users: <b><br>
--dct=int</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use integer DCT method
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--dct=fast</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use fast integer DCT (less
accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--dct=float</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use floating-point DCT method.
The float method is very slightly more accurate than the int
method, but is much slower unless your machine has very fast
floating-point hardware. Also note that results of the
floating-point method may vary slightly across machines,
while the integer methods should give the same results
everywhere. The fast integer method is much less accurate
than the other two.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--restart=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Emit a JPEG restart marker
every <i>n</i> MCU rows, or every <i>n</i> MCU blocks if you
append <b>B</b> to the number. <b>--restart 0</b> (the
default) means no restart markers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--smooth=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Smooth the input image to
eliminate dithering noise. <i>n</i>, ranging from 1 to 100,
indicates the strength of smoothing. 0 (the default) means
no smoothing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--maxmemory=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set a limit for amount of
memory to use in processing large images. Value is in
thousands of bytes, or millions of bytes if you append
<b>M</b> to the number. For example, <b>--max=4m</b> selects
4,000,000 bytes. If <b>pnmtojpeg</b> needs more space, it
will use temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print to the Standard Error
file messages about the conversion process. This can be
helpful in debugging problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>--restart</b> option tells <b>pnmtojpeg</b> to insert
extra markers that allow a JPEG decoder to resynchronize
after a transmission error. Without restart markers, any
damage to a compressed file will usually ruin the image from
the point of the error to the end of the image; with restart
markers, the damage is usually confined to the portion of
the image up to the next restart marker. Of course, the
restart markers occupy extra space. We recommend
<b>--restart=1</b> for images that will be transmitted
across unreliable networks such as Usenet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>--smooth</b> option filters the input to eliminate
fine-scale noise. This is often useful when converting
dithered images to JFIF: a moderate smoothing factor of 10
to 50 gets rid of dithering patterns in the input file,
resulting in a smaller JFIF file and a better-looking image.
Too large a smoothing factor will visibly blur the image,
however.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Options for
wizards: <b><br>
--baseline</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Force baseline-compatible
quantization tables to be generated. This clamps
quantization values to 8 bits even at low quality settings.
(This switch is poorly named, since it does not ensure that
the output is actually baseline JPEG. For example, you can
use <b>--baseline</b> and <b>--progressive</b>
together.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--qtables=</b><i>filespec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use the quantization tables
given in the specified text file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--qslots=n[,...]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select which quantization table
to use for each color component.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--sample=</b><i>HxV[,...]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set JPEG sampling factors for
each color component.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--scans=</b><i>filespec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use the scan script given in
the specified text file. See below for information on scan
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;wizard&quot; options are intended for experimentation
with JPEG. If you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing,
<b>don&rsquo;t use them</b>. These switches are documented
further in the file wizard.doc that comes with the
Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s JPEG library.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
compresses the PPM file foo.ppm with a quality factor of 60
and saves the output as foo.jpg:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmtojpeg
--quality=60 foo.ppm &gt; foo.jpg</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cat foo.bmp
| bmptoppm | pnmtojpeg &gt; foo.jpg</b></p>

<h2>HINTS
<a name="HINTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">JFIF is not
ideal for cartoons, line drawings, and other images that
have only a few distinct colors. For those, try instead
<b>pnmtopng</b> or <b>ppmtobmp</b>. If you need to convert
such an image to JFIF, though, you should experiment with
<b>pnmtojpeg</b>&rsquo;s <b>--quality</b> and
<b>--smooth</b> options to get a satisfactory conversion.
<b>--smooth 10</b> or so is often helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">JPEG
compression is notable for being a &quot;lossy.&quot; This
means that, unlike with most graphics conversions, you lose
information, which means image quality, when you convert to
JFIF. If you convert from PPM to JFIF and back repeatedly,
image quality loss will accumulate. After ten or so cycles
the image may be noticeably worse than it was after one
cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of
this, you should do all the manipulation you have to do on
the image in some other format and convert to JFIF as the
last step. And if you can keep a copy in the original
format, so much the better. PNG is a good choice for a
format that is lossless, yet fairly compact. GIF is another
way to go, but chances are you can&rsquo;t create a GIF
image without owing a lot of money to Unisys and IBM,
holders of patents on the LZW compression used in the GIF
format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>--optimize</b> option to <b>pnmtojpeg</b> is worth using
when you are making a &quot;final&quot; version for posting
or archiving. It&rsquo;s also a win when you are using low
quality settings to make very small JFIF files; the
percentage improvement is often a lot more than it is on
larger files. (At present, <b>--optimize</b> mode is
automatically in effect when you generate a progressive JPEG
file).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another
program, <b>cjpeg</b>, is similar. <b>cjpeg</b> is
maintained by the Independent JPEG Group and packaged with
the JPEG library which <b>pnmtojpeg</b> uses for all its
JPEG work. Because of that, you may expect it to exploit
more current JPEG features. Also, since you have to have the
library to run <b>pnmtojpeg</b>, but not vice versa,
<b>cjpeg</b> may be more commonly available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, <b>cjpeg</b> does not use the NetPBM libraries to
process its input, as all the NetPBM tools such as
<b>pnmtojpeg</b> do. This means it is less likely to be
consistent with all the other programs that deal with the
NetPBM formats. Also, the command syntax of <b>pnmtojpeg</b>
is consistent with that of the other Netpbm tools, unlike
<b>cjpeg</b>.</p>

<h2>SCAN SCRIPTS
<a name="SCAN SCRIPTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use the
<b>-scan</b> option to specify a scan script. Or use the
<b>-progressive</b> option to specify a particular built-in
scan script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Just what a
scan script is, and the basic format of the scan script
file, is covered in the <b>wizard.doc</b> file that comes
with the Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s JPEG library. Scan
scripts are same for <b>pnmtojpeg</b> as the are for
<b>cjpeg</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
contains additional information that isn&rsquo;t, but
probably should be, in that document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, there
are many restrictions on what is a valid scan script. The
JPEG library, and thus <b>pnmtojpeg</b>, checks thoroughly
for any lack of compliance with these restrictions, but does
little to tell you how the script fails to comply. The
messages are very general and sometimes untrue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To start with,
the entries for the DC coefficient must come before any
entries for the AC coefficients. The DC coefficient is
Coefficient 0; all the other coefficients are AC
coefficients. So in an entry for the DC coefficient, the two
numbers after the colon must be 0 and 0. In an entry for AC
coefficients, the first number after the colon must not be
0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a DC entry,
the color components must be in increasing order. E.g.
&quot;0,2,1&quot; before the colon is wrong. So is
&quot;0,0,0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In an entry for
an AC coeffient, you must specify only one color component.
I.e. there can be only one number before the colon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the first
entry for a particular coefficient for a particular color
component, the &quot;Ah&quot; value must be zero, but the Al
value can be any valid bit number. In subsequent entries, Ah
must be the Al value from the previous entry (for that
coefficient for that color component), and the Al value must
be one less than the Ah value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The script must
ultimately specify at least some of the DC coefficent for
every color component. Otherwise, you get the error message
&quot;Script does not transmit all the data.&quot; You need
not specify all of the bits of the DC coefficient, or any of
the AC coefficients.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
standard option in building the JPEG library to omit scan
script capability. If for some reason your library was built
with this option, you get the message &quot;Requested
feature was omitted at compile time.&quot;</p>
