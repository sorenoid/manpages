<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-fast-export
- Git data exporter</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
fast-export [&lt;options&gt;]</i> | <i>git
fast-import</i></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program
dumps the given revisions in a form suitable to be piped
into <i>git fast-import</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use it
as a human-readable bundle replacement (see
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-bundle">git-bundle(1)</a>), or as a format that can be edited
before being fed to <i>git fast-import</i> in order to do
history rewrites (an ability relied on by tools like <i>git
filter-repo</i>).</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--progress=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Insert <i>progress</i>
statements every &lt;n&gt; objects, to be shown by <i>git
fast-import</i> during import.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--signed-tags=(verbatim|warn|warn-strip|strip|abort)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify how to handle signed
tags. Since any transformation after the export can change
the tag names (which can also happen when excluding
revisions) the signatures will not match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When asking to
<i>abort</i> (which is the default), this program will die
when encountering a signed tag. With <i>strip</i>, the tags
will silently be made unsigned, with <i>warn-strip</i> they
will be made unsigned but a warning will be displayed, with
<i>verbatim</i>, they will be silently exported and with
<i>warn</i>, they will be exported, but you will see a
warning.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--tag-of-filtered-object=(abort|drop|rewrite)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify how to handle tags
whose tagged object is filtered out. Since revisions and
files to export can be limited by path, tagged objects may
be filtered completely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When asking to
<i>abort</i> (which is the default), this program will die
when encountering such a tag. With <i>drop</i> it will omit
such tags from the output. With <i>rewrite</i>, if the
tagged object is a commit, it will rewrite the tag to tag an
ancestor commit (via parent rewriting; see
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-rev-list">git-rev-list(1)</a>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-M, -C</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perform move and/or copy
detection, as described in the <a href="https://man.page/1/git-diff">git-diff(1)</a> manual
page, and use it to generate rename and copy commands in the
output dump.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
earlier versions of this command did not complain and
produced incorrect results if you gave these options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--export-marks=&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Dumps the internal marks table
to &lt;file&gt; when complete. Marks are written one per
line as <b>:markid SHA-1</b>. Only marks for revisions are
dumped; marks for blobs are ignored. Backends can use this
file to validate imports after they have been completed, or
to save the marks table across incremental runs. As
&lt;file&gt; is only opened and truncated at completion, the
same path can also be safely given to --import-marks. The
file will not be written if no new object has been
marked/exported.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--import-marks=&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Before processing any input,
load the marks specified in &lt;file&gt;. The input file
must exist, must be readable, and must use the same format
as produced by --export-marks.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--mark-tags</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In addition to labelling blobs
and commits with mark ids, also label tags. This is useful
in conjunction with <b>--export-marks</b> and
<b>--import-marks</b>, and is also useful (and necessary)
for exporting of nested tags. It does not hurt other cases
and would be the default, but many fast-import frontends are
not prepared to accept tags with mark identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any commits (or
tags) that have already been marked will not be exported
again. If the backend uses a similar --import-marks file,
this allows for incremental bidirectional exporting of the
repository by keeping the marks the same across runs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--fake-missing-tagger</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some old repositories have tags
without a tagger. The fast-import protocol was pretty strict
about that, and did not allow that. So fake a tagger to be
able to fast-import the output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--use-done-feature</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Start the stream with a
<i>feature done</i> stanza, and terminate it with a
<i>done</i> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--no-data</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Skip output of blob objects and
instead refer to blobs via their original SHA-1 hash. This
is useful when rewriting the directory structure or history
of a repository without touching the contents of individual
files. Note that the resulting stream can only be used by a
repository which already contains the necessary objects.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--full-tree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option will cause
fast-export to issue a &quot;deleteall&quot; directive for
each commit followed by a full list of all files in the
commit (as opposed to just listing the files which are
different from the commit&rsquo;s first parent).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--anonymize</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Anonymize the contents of the
repository while still retaining the shape of the history
and stored tree. See the section on <b>ANONYMIZING</b>
below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--anonymize-map=&lt;from&gt;[:&lt;to&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Convert token
<b>&lt;from&gt;</b> to <b>&lt;to&gt;</b> in the anonymized
output. If <b>&lt;to&gt;</b> is omitted, map
<b>&lt;from&gt;</b> to itself (i.e., do not anonymize it).
See the section on <b>ANONYMIZING</b> below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--reference-excluded-parents</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, running a command
such as <b>git fast-export master~5..master</b> will not
include the commit master~5 and will make master~4 no longer
have master~5 as a parent (though both the old master~4 and
new master~4 will have all the same files). Use
--reference-excluded-parents to instead have the stream
refer to commits in the excluded range of history by their
sha1sum. Note that the resulting stream can only be used by
a repository which already contains the necessary parent
commits.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--show-original-ids</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add an extra directive to the
output for commits and blobs, <b>original-oid
&lt;SHA1SUM&gt;</b>. While such directives will likely be
ignored by importers such as git-fast-import, it may be
useful for intermediary filters (e.g. for rewriting commit
messages which refer to older commits, or for stripping
blobs by id).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--reencode=(yes|no|abort)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify how to handle
<b>encoding</b> header in commit objects. When asking to
<i>abort</i> (which is the default), this program will die
when encountering such a commit object. With <i>yes</i>, the
commit message will be re-encoded into UTF-8. With
<i>no</i>, the original encoding will be preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--refspec</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply the specified refspec to
each ref exported. Multiple of them can be specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[&lt;git-rev-list-args&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A list of arguments, acceptable
to <i>git rev-parse</i> and <i>git rev-list</i>, that
specifies the specific objects and references to export. For
example, <b>master~10..master</b> causes the current master
reference to be exported along with all objects added since
its 10th ancestor commit and (unless the
--reference-excluded-parents option is specified) all files
common to master~9 and master~10.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
fast-export --all | (cd /empty/repository &amp;&amp; git
fast-import)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will
export the whole repository and import it into the existing
empty repository. Except for reencoding commits that are not
in UTF-8, it would be a one-to-one mirror.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
fast-export master~5..master | <br>
sed &quot;s|refs/heads/master|refs/heads/other|&quot; | <br>
git fast-import</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This makes a
new branch called <i>other</i> from <i>master~5..master</i>
(i.e. if <i>master</i> has linear history, it will take the
last 5 commits).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
assumes that none of the blobs and commit messages
referenced by that revision range contains the string
<i>refs/heads/master</i>.</p>

<h2>ANONYMIZING
<a name="ANONYMIZING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>--anonymize</b> option is given, git will attempt to
remove all identifying information from the repository while
still retaining enough of the original tree and history
patterns to reproduce some bugs. The goal is that a git bug
which is found on a private repository will persist in the
anonymized repository, and the latter can be shared with git
developers to help solve the bug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With this
option, git will replace all refnames, paths, blob contents,
commit and tag messages, names, and email addresses in the
output with anonymized data. Two instances of the same
string will be replaced equivalently (e.g., two commits with
the same author will have the same anonymized author in the
output, but bear no resemblance to the original author
string). The relationship between commits, branches, and
tags is retained, as well as the commit timestamps (but the
commit messages and refnames bear no resemblance to the
originals). The relative makeup of the tree is retained
(e.g., if you have a root tree with 10 files and 3 trees, so
will the output), but their names and the contents of the
files will be replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you think
you have found a git bug, you can start by exporting an
anonymized stream of the whole repository:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
fast-export --anonymize --all &gt;anon-stream</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then confirm
that the bug persists in a repository created from that
stream (many bugs will not, as they really do depend on the
exact repository contents):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git init
anon-repo <br>
$ cd anon-repo <br>
$ git fast-import &lt;../anon-stream <br>
$ ... test your bug ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
anonymized repository shows the bug, it may be worth sharing
<b>anon-stream</b> along with a regular bug report. Note
that the anonymized stream compresses very well, so gzipping
it is encouraged. If you want to examine the stream to see
that it does not contain any private data, you can peruse it
directly before sending. You may also want to try:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ perl -pe
's/\d+/X/g' &lt;anon-stream | sort -u | less</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">which shows all
of the unique lines (with numbers converted to
&quot;X&quot;, to collapse &quot;User 0&quot;, &quot;User
1&quot;, etc into &quot;User X&quot;). This produces a much
smaller output, and it is usually easy to quickly confirm
that there is no private data in the stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reproducing
some bugs may require referencing particular commits or
paths, which becomes challenging after refnames and paths
have been anonymized. You can ask for a particular token to
be left as-is or mapped to a new value. For example, if you
have a bug which reproduces with <b>git rev-list sensitive
-- secret.c</b>, you can run:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
fast-export --anonymize --all \ <br>
--anonymize-map=sensitive:foo \ <br>
--anonymize-map=secret.c:bar.c \ <br>
&gt;stream</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After importing
the stream, you can then run <b>git rev-list foo --
bar.c</b> in the anonymized repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that paths
and refnames are split into tokens at slash boundaries. The
command above would anonymize <b>subdir/secret.c</b> as
something like <b>path123/bar.c</b>; you could then search
for <b>bar.c</b> in the anonymized repository to determine
the final pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make
referencing the final pathname simpler, you can map each
path component; so if you also anonymize <b>subdir</b> to
<b>publicdir</b>, then the final pathname would be
<b>publicdir/bar.c</b>.</p>

<h2>LIMITATIONS
<a name="LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since <i>git
fast-import</i> cannot tag trees, you will not be able to
export the linux.git repository completely, as it contains a
tag referencing a tree instead of a commit.</p>
