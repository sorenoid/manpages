<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are many
situations where X.509 certificates are verified within the
OpenSSL libraries and in various OpenSSL commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certificate
verification is implemented by <b>X509_verify_cert</b>(3).
It is a complicated process consisting of a number of steps
and depending on numerous options. The most important of
them are detailed in the following sections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a nutshell,
a valid chain of certificates needs to be built up and
verified starting from the <i>target certificate</i> that is
to be verified and ending in a certificate that due to some
policy is trusted. Verification is done relative to the
given <i>purpose</i>, which is the intended use of the
target certificate, such as <small>SSL</small> server, or by
default for any purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The details of
how each OpenSSL command handles errors are documented on
the specific command page.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>DANE</small>
support is documented in <b>openssl-s_client</b>(1),
<b>SSL_CTX_dane_enable</b>(3), <b>SSL_set1_host</b>(3),
<b>X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags</b>(3), and
<b>X509_check_host</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Trust
Anchors</b> <br>
In general, according to <small>RFC 4158</small> and
<small>RFC 5280,</small> a <i>trust anchor</i> is any public
key and related subject distinguished name (
<small>DN</small> ) that for some reason is considered
trusted and thus is acceptable as the root of a chain of
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In practice,
trust anchors are given in the form of certificates, where
their essential fields are the public key and the subject
<small>DN.</small> In addition to the requirements in
<small>RFC 5280,</small> OpenSSL checks the validity period
of such certificates and makes use of some further fields.
In particular, the subject key identifier extension, if
present, is used for matching trust anchors during chain
building.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the most
simple and common case, trust anchors are by default all
self-signed &quot;root&quot; <small>CA</small> certificates
that are placed in the <i>trust store</i>, which is a
collection of certificates that are trusted for certain
uses. This is akin to what is used in the trust stores of
Mozilla Firefox, or Apple&rsquo;s and Microsoft&rsquo;s
certificate stores, ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From the
OpenSSL perspective, a trust anchor is a certificate that
should be augmented with an explicit designation for which
uses of a target certificate the certificate may serve as a
trust anchor. In <small>PEM</small> encoding, this is
indicated by the &quot;TRUSTED CERTIFICATE&quot; string.
Such a designation provides a set of positive trust
attributes explicitly stating trust for the listed purposes
and/or a set of negative trust attributes explicitly
rejecting the use for the listed purposes. The purposes are
encoded using the values defined for the extended key usages
(EKUs) that may be given in X.509 extensions of end-entity
certificates. See also the &quot;Extended Key Usage&quot;
section below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The currently
recognized uses are <b>clientAuth</b> ( <small>SSL</small>
client use), <b>serverAuth</b> ( <small>SSL</small> server
use), <b>emailProtection</b> (S/MIME email use),
<b>codeSigning</b> (object signer use), <b>OCSPSigning</b> (
<small>OCSP</small> responder use),
<b><small>OCSP</small></b> ( <small>OCSP</small> request
use), <b>timeStamping</b> ( <small>TSA</small> server use),
and <b>anyExtendedKeyUsage</b>. As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, the
last of these blocks all uses when rejected or enables all
uses when trusted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A certificate,
which may be <small>CA</small> certificate or an end-entity
certificate, is considered a trust anchor for the given use
if and only if all the following conditions hold:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>It is an an element of the trust store.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>It does not have a negative trust attribute rejecting
the given use.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>It has a positive trust attribute accepting the given
use or (by default) one of the following compatibilty
conditions apply: It is self-signed or the
<b>-partial_chain</b> option is given (which corresponds to
the <b>X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN</b> flag being set).</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Certification
Path Building</b> <br>
First, a certificate chain is built up starting from the
target certificate and ending in a trust anchor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The chain is
built up iteratively, looking up in turn a certificate with
suitable key usage that matches as an issuer of the current
&quot;subject&quot; certificate as described below. If there
is such a certificate, the first one found that is currently
valid is taken, otherwise the one that expired most recently
of all such certificates. For efficiency, no backtracking is
performed, thus any further candidate issuer certificates
that would match equally are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a
self-signed certificate has been added, chain construction
stops. In this case it must fully match a trust anchor,
otherwise chain building fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A candidate
issuer certificate matches a subject certificate if all of
the following conditions hold:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Its subject name matches the
issuer name of the subject certificate.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If the subject certificate has an authority key
identifier extension, each of its sub-fields equals the
corresponding subject key identifier, serial number, and
issuer field of the candidate issuer certificate, as far as
the respective fields are present in both certificates.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>The certificate signature algorithm used to sign the
subject certificate is supported and equals the public key
algorithm of the candidate issuer certificate.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The lookup
first searches for issuer certificates in the trust store.
If it does not find a match there it consults the list of
untrusted (&quot;intermediate&quot; <small>CA</small> )
certificates, if provided.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Certification
Path Validation</b> <br>
When the certificate chain building process was successful
the chain components and their links are checked
thoroughly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first step
is to check that each certificate is well-formed. Part of
these checks are enabled only if the <b>-x509_strict</b>
option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second step
is to check the extensions of every untrusted certificate
for consistency with the supplied purpose. If the
<b>-purpose</b> option is not given then no such checks are
done except for <small>SSL/TLS</small> connection setup,
where by default &quot;sslserver&quot; or
&quot;sslclient&quot;, are checked. The target or
&quot;leaf&quot; certificate, as well as any other untrusted
certificates, must have extensions compatible with the
specified purpose. All certificates except the target or
&quot;leaf&quot; must also be valid <small>CA</small>
certificates. The precise extensions required are described
in more detail in &quot; <small>CERTIFICATE
EXTENSIONS&quot;</small> in <b>openssl-x509</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third step
is to check the trust settings on the last certificate
(which typically is a self-signed root <small>CA</small>
certificate). It must be trusted for the given use. For
compatibility with previous versions of OpenSSL, a
self-signed certificate with no trust attributes is
considered to be valid for all uses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fourth, and
final, step is to check the validity of the certificate
chain. For each element in the chain, including the root
<small>CA</small> certificate, the validity period as
specified by the &quot;notBefore&quot; and
&quot;notAfter&quot; fields is checked against the current
system time. The <b>-attime</b> flag may be used to use a
reference time other than &quot;now.&quot; The certificate
signature is checked as well (except for the signature of
the typically self-signed root <small>CA</small>
certificate, which is verified only if the
<b>-check_ss_sig</b> option is given). When verifying a
certificate signature the keyUsage extension (if present) of
the candidate issuer certificate is checked to permit
digitalSignature for signing proxy certificates or to permit
keyCertSign for signing other certificates, respectively. If
all operations complete successfully then certificate is
considered valid. If any operation fails then the
certificate is not valid.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Trusted
Certificate Options</b> <br>
The following options specify how to supply the certificates
that can be used as trust anchors for certain uses. As
mentioned, a collection of such certificates is called a
<i>trust store</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
OpenSSL does not provide a default set of trust anchors.
Many Linux distributions include a system default and
configure OpenSSL to point to that. Mozilla maintains an
influential trust store that can be found at
&lt;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
certificates to add to the trust store can be specified
using following options. <b><br>
-CAfile</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Load the specified file which
contains a certificate or several of them in case the input
is in <small>PEM</small> or PKCS#12 format. PEM-encoded
certificates may also have trust attributes set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-no-CAfile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not load the default file of
trusted certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-CApath</b> <i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the specified directory as
a collection of trusted certificates, i.e., a trust store.
Files should be named with the hash value of the X.509
SubjectName of each certificate. This is so that the library
can extract the IssuerName, hash it, and directly lookup the
file to get the issuer certificate. See
<b>openssl-rehash</b>(1) for information on creating this
type of directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-no-CApath</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not use the default
directory of trusted certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-CAstore</b> <i>uri</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use <i>uri</i> as a store of
<small>CA</small> certificates. The <small>URI</small> may
indicate a single certificate, as well as a collection of
them. With URIs in the &quot;file:&quot; scheme, this acts
as <b>-CAfile</b> or <b>-CApath</b>, depending on if the
<small>URI</small> indicates a single file or directory. See
<b>ossl_store-file</b>(7) for more information on the
&quot;file:&quot; scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These
certificates are also used when building the server
certificate chain (for example with
<b>openssl-s_server</b>(1)) or client certificate chain (for
example with <b>openssl-s_time</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-no-CAstore</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not use the default store of
trusted <small>CA</small> certificates.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Verification
Options</b> <br>
The certificate verification can be fine-tuned with the
following flags. <b><br>
-verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print extra information about
the operations being performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-attime</b>
<i>timestamp</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perform validation checks using
time specified by <i>timestamp</i> and not current system
time. <i>timestamp</i> is the number of seconds since
January 1, 1970 (i.e., the Unix Epoch).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-no_check_time</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option suppresses checking
the validity period of certificates and CRLs against the
current time. If option <b>-attime</b> is used to specify a
verification time, the check is not suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-x509_strict</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This disables non-compliant
workarounds for broken certificates. Thus errors are thrown
on certificates not compliant with <small>RFC
5280.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When this
option is set, among others, the following certificate
well-formedness conditions are checked:</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-ignore_critical</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Normally if an unhandled
critical extension is present that is not supported by
OpenSSL the certificate is rejected (as required by
<small>RFC5280</small> ). If this option is set critical
extensions are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-issuer_checks</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-crl_check</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Checks end entity certificate
validity by attempting to look up a valid
<small>CRL.</small> If a valid <small>CRL</small> cannot be
found an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-crl_check_all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Checks the validity of
<b>all</b> certificates in the chain by attempting to look
up valid CRLs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-use_deltas</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable support for delta
CRLs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-extended_crl</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable extended
<small>CRL</small> features such as indirect CRLs and
alternate <small>CRL</small> signing keys.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-suiteB_128_only</b>,
<b>-suiteB_128</b>, <b>-suiteB_192</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable the Suite B mode
operation at 128 bit Level of Security, 128 bit or 192 bit,
or only 192 bit Level of Security respectively. See
<small>RFC6460</small> for details. In particular the
supported signature algorithms are reduced to support only
<small>ECDSA</small> and <small>SHA256</small> or
<small>SHA384</small> and only the elliptic curves P-256 and
P-384.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-auth_level</b>
<i>level</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the certificate chain
authentication security level to <i>level</i>. The
authentication security level determines the acceptable
signature and public key strength when verifying certificate
chains. For a certificate chain to validate, the public keys
of all the certificates must meet the specified security
<i>level</i>. The signature algorithm security level is
enforced for all the certificates in the chain except for
the chain&rsquo;s <i>trust anchor</i>, which is either
directly trusted or validated by means other than its
signature. See <b>SSL_CTX_set_security_level</b>(3) for the
definitions of the available levels. The default security
level is -1, or &quot;not set&quot;. At security level 0 or
lower all algorithms are acceptable. Security level 1
requires at least 80-bit-equivalent security and is broadly
interoperable, though it will, for example, reject
<small>MD5</small> signatures or <small>RSA</small> keys
shorter than 1024 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-partial_chain</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow verification to succeed
if an incomplete chain can be built. That is, a chain ending
in a certificate that normally would not be trusted (because
it has no matching positive trust attributes and is not
self-signed) but is an element of the trust store. This
certificate may be self-issued or belong to an intermediate
<small>CA.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-check_ss_sig</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Verify the signature of the
last certificate in a chain if the certificate is supposedly
self-signed. This is prohibited and will result in an error
if it is a non-conforming <small>CA</small> certificate with
key usage restrictions not including the keyCertSign bit.
This verification is disabled by default because it
doesn&rsquo;t add any security.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-allow_proxy_certs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow the verification of proxy
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-trusted_first</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As of OpenSSL 1.1.0 this option
is on by default and cannot be disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
constructing the certificate chain, the trusted certificates
specified via <b>-CAfile</b>, <b>-CApath</b>,
<b>-CAstore</b> or <b>-trusted</b> are always used before
any certificates specified via <b>-untrusted</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-no_alt_chains</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, since
<b>-trusted_first</b> always on, this option has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-trusted</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Parse <i>file</i> as a set of
one or more certificates. Each of them qualifies as trusted
if has a suitable positive trust attribute or it is
self-signed or the <b>-partial_chain</b> option is
specified. This option implies the <b>-no-CAfile</b>,
<b>-no-CApath</b>, and <b>-no-CAstore</b> options and it
cannot be used with the <b>-CAfile</b>, <b>-CApath</b> or
<b>-CAstore</b> options, so only certificates specified
using the <b>-trusted</b> option are trust anchors. This
option may be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-untrusted</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Parse <i>file</i> as a set of
one or more certificates. All certificates (typically of
intermediate CAs) are considered untrusted and may be used
to construct a certificate chain from the target certificate
to a trust anchor. This option may be used multiple
times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-policy</b> <i>arg</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable policy processing and
add <i>arg</i> to the user-initial-policy-set (see
<small>RFC5280</small> ). The policy <i>arg</i> can be an
object name an <small>OID</small> in numeric form. This
argument can appear more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-explicit_policy</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set policy variable
require-explicit-policy (see <small>RFC5280</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-policy_check</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables certificate policy
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-policy_print</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print out diagnostics related
to policy processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-inhibit_any</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set policy variable
inhibit-any-policy (see <small>RFC5280</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-inhibit_map</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set policy variable
inhibit-policy-mapping (see <small>RFC5280</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-purpose</b>
<i>purpose</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The intended use for the
certificate. Currently defined purposes are
&quot;sslclient&quot;, &quot;sslserver&quot;,
&quot;nssslserver&quot;, &quot;smimesign&quot;,
&quot;smimeencrypt&quot;, &quot;crlsign&quot;,
&quot;ocsphelper&quot;, &quot;timestampsign&quot;, and
&quot;any&quot;. If peer certificate verification is
enabled, by default the <small>TLS</small> implementation as
well as the commands <b>s_client</b> and <b>s_server</b>
check for consistency with <small>TLS</small> server or
<small>TLS</small> client use, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">While
<small>IETF RFC 5280</small> says that
<b>id-kp-serverAuth</b> and <b>id-kp-clientAuth</b> are only
for <small>WWW</small> use, in practice they are used for
all kinds of <small>TLS</small> clients and servers, and
this is what OpenSSL assumes as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-verify_depth</b>
<i>num</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the certificate chain to
<i>num</i> intermediate <small>CA</small> certificates. A
maximal depth chain can have up to <i>num</i>+2
certificates, since neither the end-entity certificate nor
the trust-anchor certificate count against the
<b>-verify_depth</b> limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-verify_email</b>
<i>email</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Verify if <i>email</i> matches
the email address in Subject Alternative Name or the email
in the subject Distinguished Name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-verify_hostname</b>
<i>hostname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Verify if <i>hostname</i>
matches <small>DNS</small> name in Subject Alternative Name
or Common Name in the subject certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-verify_ip</b> <i>ip</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Verify if <i>ip</i> matches the
<small>IP</small> address in Subject Alternative Name of the
subject certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-verify_name</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use default verification
policies like trust model and required certificate policies
identified by <i>name</i>. The trust model determines which
auxiliary trust or reject OIDs are applicable to verifying
the given certificate chain. They can be given using the
<b>-addtrust</b> and <b>-addreject</b> options for
<b>openssl-x509</b>(1). Supported policy names include:
<b>default</b>, <b>pkcs7</b>, <b>smime_sign</b>,
<b>ssl_client</b>, <b>ssl_server</b>. These mimics the
combinations of purpose and trust settings used in
<small>SSL, CMS</small> and S/MIME. As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, the
trust model is inferred from the purpose when not specified,
so the <b>-verify_name</b> options are functionally
equivalent to the corresponding <b>-purpose</b>
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Extended
Verification Options</b> <br>
Sometimes there may be more than one certificate chain
leading to an end-entity certificate. This usually happens
when a root or intermediate <small>CA</small> signs a
certificate for another a <small>CA</small> in other
organization. Another reason is when a <small>CA</small>
might have intermediates that use two different signature
formats, such as a <small>SHA-1</small> and a
<small>SHA-256</small> digest.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options can be used to provide data that will allow the
OpenSSL command to generate an alternative chain. <b><br>
-xkey</b> <i>infile</i>, <b>-xcert</b> <i>infile</i>,
<b>-xchain</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify an extra certificate,
private key and certificate chain. These behave in the same
manner as the <b>-cert</b>, <b>-key</b> and
<b>-cert_chain</b> options. When specified, the callback
returning the first valid chain will be in use by the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-xchain_build</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify whether the application
should build the certificate chain to be provided to the
server for the extra certificates via the <b>-xkey</b>,
<b>-xcert</b>, and <b>-xchain</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-xcertform
<small>DER</small></b> | <b><small>PEM</small></b>
|<b>P12</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The input format for the extra
certificate. This option has no effect and is retained for
backward compatibility only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-xkeyform
<small>DER</small></b> | <b><small>PEM</small></b>
|<b>P12</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The input format for the extra
key. This option has no effect and is retained for backward
compatibility only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Certificate
Extensions</b> <br>
Options like <b>-purpose</b> lead to checking the
certificate extensions, which determine what the target
certificate and intermediate <small>CA</small> certificates
can be used for.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Basic
Constraints</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
basicConstraints extension <small>CA</small> flag is used to
determine whether the certificate can be used as a
<small>CA.</small> If the <small>CA</small> flag is true
then it is a <small>CA,</small> if the <small>CA</small>
flag is false then it is not a <small>CA.</small> <b>All</b>
CAs should have the <small>CA</small> flag set to true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
basicConstraints extension is absent, which includes the
case that it is an X.509v1 certificate, then the certificate
is considered to be a &quot;possible <small>CA&quot;</small>
and other extensions are checked according to the intended
use of the certificate. The treatment of certificates
without basicConstraints as a <small>CA</small> is presently
supported, but this could change in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Key
Usage</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the keyUsage
extension is present then additional restraints are made on
the uses of the certificate. A <small>CA</small> certificate
<b>must</b> have the keyCertSign bit set if the keyUsage
extension is present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Extended Key
Usage</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The extKeyUsage
( <small>EKU</small> ) extension places additional
restrictions on the certificate uses. If this extension is
present (whether critical or not) the key can only be used
for the purposes specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A complete
description of each check is given below. The comments about
basicConstraints and keyUsage and X.509v1 certificates above
apply to <b>all</b> <small>CA</small> certificates.
<b><small><br>
SSL</small> Client</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The extended key usage
extension must be absent or include the &quot;web client
authentication&quot; <small>OID.</small> The keyUsage
extension must be absent or it must have the
digitalSignature bit set. The Netscape certificate type must
be absent or it must have the <small>SSL</small> client bit
set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>SSL</small> Client
<small>CA</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The extended key usage
extension must be absent or include the &quot;web client
authentication&quot; <small>OID.</small> The Netscape
certificate type must be absent or it must have the
<small>SSL CA</small> bit set. This is used as a work around
if the basicConstraints extension is absent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>SSL</small>
Server</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The extended key usage
extension must be absent or include the &quot;web server
authentication&quot; and/or one of the <small>SGC</small>
OIDs. The keyUsage extension must be absent or it must have
the digitalSignature, the keyEncipherment set or both bits
set. The Netscape certificate type must be absent or have
the <small>SSL</small> server bit set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>SSL</small> Server
<small>CA</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The extended key usage
extension must be absent or include the &quot;web server
authentication&quot; and/or one of the <small>SGC</small>
OIDs. The Netscape certificate type must be absent or the
<small>SSL CA</small> bit must be set. This is used as a
work around if the basicConstraints extension is absent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Netscape <small>SSL</small>
Server</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For Netscape <small>SSL</small>
clients to connect to an <small>SSL</small> server it must
have the keyEncipherment bit set if the keyUsage extension
is present. This isn&rsquo;t always valid because some
cipher suites use the key for digital signing. Otherwise it
is the same as a normal <small>SSL</small> server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Common S/MIME Client
Tests</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The extended key usage
extension must be absent or include the &quot;email
protection&quot; <small>OID.</small> The Netscape
certificate type must be absent or should have the S/MIME
bit set. If the S/MIME bit is not set in the Netscape
certificate type then the <small>SSL</small> client bit is
tolerated as an alternative but a warning is shown. This is
because some Verisign certificates don&rsquo;t set the
S/MIME bit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>S/MIME Signing</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In addition to the common
S/MIME client tests the digitalSignature bit or the
nonRepudiation bit must be set if the keyUsage extension is
present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>S/MIME Encryption</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In addition to the common
S/MIME tests the keyEncipherment bit must be set if the
keyUsage extension is present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>S/MIME
<small>CA</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The extended key usage
extension must be absent or include the &quot;email
protection&quot; <small>OID.</small> The Netscape
certificate type must be absent or must have the S/MIME
<small>CA</small> bit set. This is used as a work around if
the basicConstraints extension is absent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>CRL</small>
Signing</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The keyUsage extension must be
absent or it must have the <small>CRL</small> signing bit
set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>CRL</small> Signing
<small>CA</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The normal <small>CA</small>
tests apply. Except in this case the basicConstraints
extension must be present.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The issuer
checks still suffer from limitations in the underlying
X509_LOOKUP <small>API.</small> One consequence of this is
that trusted certificates with matching subject name must
appear in a file (as specified by the <b>-CAfile</b>
option), a directory (as specified by <b>-CApath</b>), or a
store (as specified by <b>-CAstore</b>). If there are
multiple such matches, possibly in multiple locations, only
the first one (in the mentioned order of locations) is
recognised.</p>
