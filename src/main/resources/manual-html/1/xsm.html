Manager</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>xsm</b>

[-verbose]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>xsm</i> is a
session manager. A session is a group of applications, each
of which has a particular state. <i>xsm</i> allows you to
create arbitrary sessions - for example, you might have a
&quot;light&quot; session, a &quot;development&quot;
session, or an &quot;xterminal&quot; session. Each session
can have its own set of applications. Within a session, you
can perform a &quot;checkpoint&quot; to save application
state, or a &quot;shutdown&quot; to save state and exit the
session. When you log back in to the system, you can load a
specific session, and you can delete sessions you no longer
want to keep.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some session
managers simply allow you to manually specify a list of
applications to be started in a session. <i>xsm</i> is more
powerful because it lets you run applications and have them
automatically become part of the session. On a simple level,
<i>xsm</i> is useful because it gives you this ability to
easily define which applications are in a session. The true
power of <i>xsm</i>, however, can be taken advantage of when
more and more applications learn to save and restore their
state.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS

<h2>SETUP
<a name="SETUP"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>.xsession
file</b> <br>
Using <i>xsm</i> requires a change to your <i>.xsession</i>
file:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last
program executed by your <i>.xsession</i> file should be
<i>xsm</i>. With this configuration, when the user chooses
to shut down the session using <i>xsm</i>, the session will
truly be over.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since the goal
of the session manager is to restart clients when logging
into a session, your .xsession file, in general, should not
directly start up applications. Rather, the applications
should be started within a session. When <i>xsm</i> shuts
down the session, <i>xsm</i> will know to restart these
applications. Note however that there are some types of
applications that are not &quot;session aware&quot;.
<i>xsm</i> allows you to manually add these applications to
your session (see the section titled <i>Client
List</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SM_SAVE_DIR
environment variable</b> <br>
If the <i>SM_SAVE_DIR</i> environment variable is defined,
<i>xsm</i> will save all configuration files in this
directory. Otherwise, they will be stored in the
user&rsquo;s home directory. Session aware applications are
also encouraged to save their checkpoint files in the
<i>SM_SAVE_DIR</i> directory, although the user should not
depend on this convention.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Default
Startup Applications</b> <br>
The first time <i>xsm</i> is started, it will need to locate
a list of applications to start up. For example, this list
might include a window manager, a session management proxy,
and an xterm. <i>xsm</i> will first look for the file
<i>.xsmstartup</i> in the user&rsquo;s home directory. If
that file does not exist, it will look for the
<i>system.xsm</i> file that was set up at installation time.
Note that <i>xsm</i> provides a &quot;fail safe&quot; option
when the user chooses a session to start up. The fail safe
option simply loads the default applications described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each line in
the startup file should contain a command to start an
application. A sample startup file might look this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;start of
file&gt; <br>
twm <br>
smproxy <br>
xterm <br>
&lt;end of file&gt;</p>

<h2>STARTING A SESSION
<a name="STARTING A SESSION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When <i>xsm</i>
starts up, it first checks to see if the user previously
saved any sessions. If no saved sessions exist, <i>xsm</i>
starts up a set of default applications (as described above
in the section titled <i>Default Startup Applications</i>).
If at least one session exists, a session menu is presented.
The <b>-session</b> option forces the specified
<i>sessionName</i> session to be loaded, bypassing the
session menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The session
menu</b> <br>
The session menu presents the user with a list of sessions
to choose from. The user can change the currently selected
session with the mouse, or by using the up and down arrows
on the keyboard. Note that sessions which are locked (i.e.
running on a different display) can not be loaded or
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
operations can be performed from the session menu:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="26%">


<p><b>Load Session</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="55%">


<p>Pressing this button will load the currently selected
session. Alternatively, hitting the Return key will also
load the currently selected session, or the user can double
click a session from the list.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="26%">


<p><b>Delete Session</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="55%">


<p>This operation will delete the currently selected
session, along with all of the application checkpoint files
associated with the session. After pressing this button, the
user will be asked to press the button a second time in
order to confirm the operation.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="26%">


<p><b>Default/Fail Safe</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="55%">


<p><i>xsm</i> will start up a set of default applications
(as described above in the section titled <i>Default Startup
Applications</i>). This is useful when the user wants to
start a fresh session, or if the session configuration files
were corrupted and the user wants a &quot;fail safe&quot;
session.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="26%">


<p><b>Cancel</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="55%">


<p>Pressing this button will cause <i>xsm</i> to exit. It
can also be used to cancel a &quot;Delete Session&quot;
operation.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<h2>CONTROLLING A SESSION
<a name="CONTROLLING A SESSION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After
<i>xsm</i> determines which session to load, it brings up
its main window, then starts up all applications that are
part of the session. The title bar for the session
manager&rsquo;s main window will contain the name of the
session that was loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are available from <i>xsm</i>&rsquo;s main
window:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="17%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Client List</b></p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="62%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing this button brings up a
window containing a list of all clients that are in the
current session. For each client, the host machine that the
client is running on is presented. As clients are added and
removed from the session, this list is updated to reflect
the changes. The user is able to control how these clients
are restarted (see below).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">By pressing the
<b>View Properties</b> button, the user can view the session
management properties associated with the currently selected
client.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">By pressing the
<b>Clone</b> button, the user can start a copy of the
selected application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">By pressing the
<b>Kill Client</b> button, the user can remove a client from
the session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">By selecting a
restart hint from the <b>Restart Hint</b> menu, the user can
control the restarting of a client. The following hints are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-</b> The
<b>Restart If Running</b> hint indicates that the client
should be restarted in the next session if it is connected
to the session manager at the end of the current
session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-</b> The
<b>Restart Anyway</b> hint indicates that the client should
be restarted in the next session even if it exits before the
current session is terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-</b> The
<b>Restart Immediately</b> hint is similar to the <b>Restart
Anyway</b> hint, but in addition, the client is meant to run
continuously. If the client exits, the session manager will
try to restart it in the current session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-</b> The
<b>Restart Never</b> hint indicates that the client should
not be restarted in the next session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">Note that all X
applications may not be &quot;session aware&quot;.
Applications that are not session aware are ones that do not
support the X Session Management Protocol or they can not be
detected by the Session Management Proxy (see the section
titled <i>THE PROXY</i>). <i>xsm</i> allows the user to
manually add such applications to the session. The bottom of
the <i>Client List</i> window contains a text entry field in
which application commands can be typed in. Each command
should go on its own line. This information will be saved
with the session at checkpoint or shutdown time. When the
session is restarted, <i>xsm</i> will restart these
applications in addition to the regular &quot;session
aware&quot; applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">Pressing the
<b>Done</b> button removes the <b>Client List</b>
window.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="21%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Session Log...</b></p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="62%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Session Log window presents
useful information about the session. For example, when a
session is restarted, all of the restart commands will be
displayed in the log window.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="21%">


<p><b>Checkpoint</b></p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="62%">


<p>By performing a checkpoint, all applications that are in
the session are asked to save their state. Not every
application will save its complete state, but at a minimum,
the session manager is guaranteed that it will receive the
command required to restart the application (along with all
command line options). A window manager participating in the
session should guarantee that the applications will come
back up with the same window configurations.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">If the session
being checkpointed was never assigned a name, the user will
be required to specify a session name. Otherwise, the user
can perform the checkpoint using the current session name,
or a new session name can be specified. If the session name
specified already exists, the user will be given the
opportunity to specify a different name or to overwrite the
already existing session. Note that a session which is
locked can not be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">When performing
a checkpoint, the user must specify a <b>Save Type</b> which
informs the applications in the session how much state they
should save.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Local</b> type indicates that the application should save
enough information to restore the state as seen by the user.
It should not affect the state as seen by other users. For
example, an editor would create a temporary file containing
the contents of its editing buffer, the location of the
cursor, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Global</b> type indicates that the application should
commit all of its data to permanent, globally accessible
storage. For example, the editor would simply save the
edited file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>Both</b>
type indicates that the application should do both of these.
For example, the editor would save the edited file, then
create a temporary file with information such as the
location of the cursor, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the <b>Save Type</b>, the user must specify an <b>Interact
Style</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>None</b>
type indicates that the application should not interact with
the user while saving state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Errors</b> type indicates that the application may
interact with the user only if an error condition
arises.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>Any</b>
type indicates that the application may interact with the
user for any purpose. Note that <i>xsm</i> will only allow
one application to interact with the user at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">After the
checkpoint is completed, <i>xsm</i> will, if necessary,
display a window containing the list of applications which
did not report a successful save of state.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="12%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Shutdown</b></p></td>
<td width="15%"></td>
<td width="62%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A shutdown provides all of the
options found in a checkpoint, but in addition, can cause
the session to exit. Note that if the interaction style is
<b>Errors</b> or <b>Any</b>, the user may cancel the
shutdown. The user may also cancel the shutdown if any of
the applications report an unsuccessful save of state.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:38%; margin-top: 1em">The user may
choose to shutdown the session with our without performing a
checkpoint.</p>

<h2>HOW XSM RESPONDS TO SIGNALS
<a name="HOW XSM RESPONDS TO SIGNALS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>xsm</i> will
respond to a SIGTERM signal by performing a shutdown with
the following options: fast, no interaction, save type
local. This allows the user&rsquo;s session to be saved when
the system is being shutdown. It can also be used to perform
a remote shutdown of a session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>xsm</i> will
respond to a SIGUSR1 signal by performing a checkpoint with
the following options: no interaction, save type local. This
signal can be used to perform a remote checkpoint of a
session.</p>

<h2>THE PROXY
<a name="THE PROXY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since not all
applications have been ported to support the X Session
Management Protocol, a proxy service exists to allow
&quot;old&quot; clients to work with the session manager. In
order for the proxy to detect an application joining a
session, one of the following must be true:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- The
application maps a top level window containing the
<b>WM_CLIENT_LEADER</b> property. This property provides a
pointer to the client leader window which contains the
<b>WM_CLASS</b>, <b>WM_NAME</b>, <b>WM_COMMAND</b>, and
<b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> properties.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- The
application maps a top level window which does not contain
the <b>WM_CLIENT_LEADER</b> property. However, this top
level window contains the <b>WM_CLASS</b>, <b>WM_NAME</b>,
<b>WM_COMMAND</b>, and <b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b>
properties.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An application
that support the <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b> protocol will
receive a <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b> client message each time
the session manager issues a checkpoint or shutdown. This
allows the application to save state. If an application does
not support the <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b> protocol, then the
proxy will provide enough information to the session manager
to restart the application (using <b>WM_COMMAND</b>), but no
state will be restored.</p>

<h2>REMOTE APPLICATIONS
<a name="REMOTE APPLICATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>xsm</i>
requires a remote execution protocol in order to restart
applications on remote machines. Currently, <i>xsm</i>
supports the <i>rstart</i> protocol. In order to restart an
application on remote machine <b>X</b>, machine <b>X</b>
must have <i>rstart</i> installed. In the future, additional
remote execution protocols may be supported.</p>
