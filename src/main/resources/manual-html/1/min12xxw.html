[options]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Min12xxw</b>
is a filter which converts pbmraw streams (produced by
ghostscript, for example) to the printer language of Minolta
PagePro 1[234]xxW printers.</p>

<h2>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
<a name="COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-h,
--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Gives usage information
(help)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v, --version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Displays the version number and
exit</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-e, --ecomode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Enables economic mode which
saves toner by leaving every other scanline blank. This
degrades the printout&rsquo;s resolution a little, the
effect is most easily seen (and looks particularly bad) when
printing in 300 dpi mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-s, --status</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Query the printer status, page
counter and whatever information can be retrieved. The
printer status is basically an unprocessed dump of what the
printer sends, so unexpected things may happen if the
printer sends funny data because it got confused somehow...
This might however still be useful. The page counter and
other information is heavily processed and should be more
reliable. Note that for queries to be made, the printer must
(of course) be switched on, with all cables connected, and
not be busy printing (or your print job may be truncated).
See the <b>-d</b> option below which sets the device file to
use. This has so far only been tested on 1200W, 1350W and
1400W printers. Send mail if it works for others as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-d dev, --device dev</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets the device file to use for
queries. The default is /dev/lp0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that this option is only meaningful with the &quot;-s&quot;
or &quot;--status&quot; option. If you intend to send a
document to the printer, you have to redirect
min12xxw&rsquo;s standard output to the device file in
question. See the documentation that came with your shell on
how to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-n, --nomargins</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Disables the enforcement of the
0.17 inch margins on all sides of the paper. The converter
discards the equivalent of this length of its input because
ghostscript outputs a full page with margins. If you
arranged in some way for the input to be marginless, or have
slightly larger paper, you can give this option to include
the full input with margins. Please note that for very small
page dimensions, min12xxw might need to disable enforcing
the page margins for all pages following the offending page
to make the job printable. In that case, a warning message
will be printed on the standard error stream to inform the
user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-m model, --model
model</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets which printer model to
produce output for. Currently, no checks for features only
available to specific models are made (available paper trays
differ from model to model, for example). Let me know if
this causes problems. Available models are: 1200W, 1250W,
1300W, 1350W, 1400W. 1200W is the default. As an
alternative, you can also symlink, link or rename your
executable to min1200w, min1250w, min1300w, min1350w or
min1400w, thus making the model specified in the filename
the default model. This saves you from typing the model
selection option again and again and again... Please note
that you <b>must</b> supply the model option correctly if
you drive any other model than what is the default. If you
fail to do so, your printer will not produce any output or
react to status queries from the host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-r resolution, --res
resolution</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets the resolution to either
300, 600 or 1200 dpi (600 dpi is the default). Keep in mind
that you need to produce your output accordingly. It is also
possible to specify the resolution as
(horizontal)x(vertical) resolution (e.g. -r 1200x600) where
horizontal resolution may be once or twice the vertical
resolution. The maximum resolution is 1200 dpi in both
vertical and horizontal direction. The minimum vertical
resolution for mixed resolution printing seems to be 600
dpi. 300 dpi printing has only been tested on 1200W, 1350W
and 1400W models. Mixed resolution printing was seen for
13xxW and 1400W models only, but tests show that the 1200W
is capable of handling it as well, so chances are that 1250W
printers won&rsquo;t have trouble, either.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t tray, --tray tray</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets the paper tray to be used.
Valid values for tray are &quot;auto&quot;,
&quot;tray1&quot;, &quot;tray2&quot; and &quot;manual&quot;,
with &quot;auto&quot; being the default. Not all printer
models have all sorts of paper trays. &quot;auto&quot;
should be safe on all of them, I think. In fact, the PagePro
1400W seems to have only this kind of paper tray.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-p type, --papertype
type</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets the type of paper used.
Type can be one of &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;thick&quot;,
&quot;transparency&quot;, &quot;envelope&quot; or
&quot;postcard&quot;. &quot;normal&quot; is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-f fmt, --paperformat
fmt</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This sets the paper format to
be used for the print job. The default value for fmt is
&quot;a4&quot;. Valid values are given below.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gs -q
-dBATCH -dSAFER -dQUIET -dNOPAUSE -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -r1200 <br>
-sDEVICE=pbmraw -sOutputFile=- - &lt; test.ps | min12xxw -r
1200 &gt; <br>
test.min</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This would convert a postscript
file test.ps to a file test.min which could be sent directly
to the printer, a 1200W to be exact. The output is rendered
at 1200 dpi. If you have to drive some other model, see the
model selection option (-m) above.</p>

<h2>PORTABILITY
<a name="PORTABILITY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Min12xxw</b>
should run on most *nix-like workstations without major
problems. Library functions which are known to be missing on
non-Linux systems such as getline or getopt_long may have to
be replaced by an appropriate substitute. In case of getline
and getopt_long this has already been done. The query
options may or may not work on other systems, depending on
the characteristics of the printer driver and the interface
used (USB, very old style parallel port or a more recent
one...).</p>

<h2>BUGS/LIMITATIONS/CONTRIBUTORS
<a name="BUGS/LIMITATIONS/CONTRIBUTORS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Min12xxw</b>
was written without any documentation from the manufacturer.
The description of the printer language may be inaccurate or
even wrong because it was obtained by looking at the output
of the windoof driver only. The code dealing with the
compression of raster data is in its spirit heavily based on
an initial driver by Adam Bocim &lt;beetman@seznam.cz&gt;
who managed to find out how things are done (thanks, Adam,
you did a great job!). This new version is considerably
faster, implemented more cleanly and (hopefully) well
documented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It also
features querying the printer status and page counter, a
suggestion made by Bruno Schoedlbauer
&lt;bruno.schoedlbauer@gmx.de&gt;, who also pointed me to a
nice USB sniffer by Benoit Papillault for Windoof 98 and up,
see http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop. (That little
program may prove very helpful on similar occasions. Happy
USB sniffing...)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">David Hamilton
&lt;dhamilto@angel.homeip.net&gt; has helped a lot in
testing and developing the support for the PagePro
1350W.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even though
this program has been designed with care and much thought,
no-one can guarantee that this program will not damage your
printer, computer or even your neighbour&rsquo;s car,
because it was built without knowing exactly how things
work, it&rsquo;s only a (hopefully) reasonable guess.
(However, my printer does still work, even after the testing
phase when a lot of wrong stuff was sent to it. And my
neighbour hasn&rsquo;t complained either...)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most of the
available paper sizes have not actually been verified to
work as advertised - reports about successes or problems are
welcome. Also the code for querying the printer is not
heavily tested. If you have comments to make or know more
about the format than I do, please share your thoughts and
your knowledge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">13xxW series
support seems to be relatively well tested by now. Send mail
with feedback if you have such a printer and you experience
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1400W support
is pretty new - please send e-mail if it works or if you run
into problems. Feedback on models for which support has just
been completed is very important to improve and stabilise
this support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bugs and
problems reports are generally welcome because I just
don&rsquo;t have the time to test everything out. I needed a
filter and here it is. If it does not work - complain
;-)</p>
