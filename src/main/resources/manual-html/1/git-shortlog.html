Summarize 'git log' output</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
shortlog</i> [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;revision range&gt;]
[[--] &lt;path&gt;...] <br>
git log --pretty=short | <i>git shortlog</i>
[&lt;options&gt;]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Summarizes
<i>git log</i> output in a format suitable for inclusion in
release announcements. Each commit will be grouped by author
and title.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
&quot;[PATCH]&quot; will be stripped from the commit
description.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no revisions
are passed on the command line and either standard input is
not a terminal or there is no current branch, <i>git
shortlog</i> will output a summary of the log read from
standard input, without reference to the current
repository.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-n,
--numbered</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sort output according to the
number of commits per author instead of author alphabetic
order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-s,
--summary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suppress commit description and
provide a commit count summary only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-e, --email</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show the email address of each
author.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--format[=&lt;format&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of the commit subject,
use some other information to describe each commit.
<i>&lt;format&gt;</i> can be any string accepted by the
<b>--format</b> option of <i>git log</i>, such as <i>* [%h]
%s</i>. (See the &quot;PRETTY FORMATS&quot; section of
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-log">git-log(1)</a>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Each
pretty-printed commit will be rewrapped before it is
shown.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--group=&lt;type&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Group commits based on
<b>&lt;type&gt;</b>. If no <b>--group</b> option is
specified, the default is <b>author</b>. <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
is one of:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>author</b>, commits are grouped by author</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>committer</b>, commits are grouped by committer (the same
as <b>-c</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>trailer:&lt;field&gt;</b>, the <b>&lt;field&gt;</b> is
interpreted as a case-insensitive commit message trailer
(see <a href="https://man.page/1/git-interpret-trailers">git-interpret-trailers(1)</a>). For example, if your
project uses <b>Reviewed-by</b> trailers, you might want to
see who has been reviewing with <b>git shortlog -ns
--group=trailer:reviewed-by</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
commits that do not include the trailer will not be counted.
Likewise, commits with multiple trailers (e.g., multiple
signoffs) may be counted more than once (but only once per
unique trailer value in that commit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Shortlog will
attempt to parse each trailer value as a <b>name
&lt;email&gt;</b> identity. If successful, the mailmap is
applied and the email is omitted unless the <b>--email</b>
option is specified. If the value cannot be parsed as an
identity, it will be taken literally and completely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>--group</b> is specified multiple times, commits are
counted under each value (but again, only once per unique
value in that commit). For example, <b>git shortlog
--group=author --group=trailer:co-authored-by</b> counts
both authors and co-authors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-c,
--committer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is an alias for
<b>--group=committer</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-w[&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;indent1&gt;[,&lt;indent2&gt;]]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Linewrap the output by wrapping
each line at <b>width</b>. The first line of each entry is
indented by <b>indent1</b> spaces, and the second and
subsequent lines are indented by <b>indent2</b> spaces.
<b>width</b>, <b>indent1</b>, and <b>indent2</b> default to
76, 6 and 9 respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If width is
<b>0</b> (zero) then indent the lines of the output without
wrapping them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;revision
range&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show only commits in the
specified revision range. When no &lt;revision range&gt; is
specified, it defaults to <b>HEAD</b> (i.e. the whole
history leading to the current commit). <b>origin..HEAD</b>
specifies all the commits reachable from the current commit
(i.e. <b>HEAD</b>), but not from <b>origin</b>. For a
complete list of ways to spell &lt;revision range&gt;, see
the &quot;Specifying Ranges&quot; section of
<a href="https://man.page/7/gitrevisions">gitrevisions(7)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[--]
&lt;path&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider only commits that are
enough to explain how the files that match the specified
paths came to be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Paths may need
to be prefixed with <b>--</b> to separate them from options
or the revision range, when confusion arises.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Commit
Limiting</b> <br>
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed
using the special notations explained in the description,
additional commit limiting may be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using more
options generally further limits the output (e.g.
<b>--since=&lt;date1&gt;</b> limits to commits newer than
<b>&lt;date1&gt;</b>, and using it with
<b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b> further limits to commits
whose log message has a line that matches
<b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>), unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that these
are applied before commit ordering and formatting options,
such as <b>--reverse</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-&lt;number&gt;,
-n &lt;number&gt;, --max-count=&lt;number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the number of commits to
output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--skip=&lt;number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Skip <i>number</i> commits
before starting to show the commit output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--since=&lt;date&gt;,
--after=&lt;date&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show commits more recent than a
specific date.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--until=&lt;date&gt;,
--before=&lt;date&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show commits older than a
specific date.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--author=&lt;pattern&gt;,
--committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the commits output to
ones with author/committer header lines that match the
specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<b>--author=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose author
matches any of the given patterns are chosen (similarly for
multiple <b>--committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the commits output to
ones with reflog entries that match the specified pattern
(regular expression). With more than one
<b>--grep-reflog</b>, commits whose reflog message matches
any of the given patterns are chosen. It is an error to use
this option unless <b>--walk-reflogs</b> is in use.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the commits output to
ones with log message that matches the specified pattern
(regular expression). With more than one
<b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose message matches
any of the given patterns are chosen (but see
<b>--all-match</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>--notes</b> is in effect, the message from the notes is
matched as if it were part of the log message.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--all-match</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the commits output to
ones that match all given <b>--grep</b>, instead of ones
that match at least one.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--invert-grep</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the commits output to
ones with log message that do not match the pattern
specified with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-i,
--regexp-ignore-case</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Match the regular expression
limiting patterns without regard to letter case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--basic-regexp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider the limiting patterns
to be basic regular expressions; this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-E,
--extended-regexp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider the limiting patterns
to be extended regular expressions instead of the default
basic regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-F,
--fixed-strings</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider the limiting patterns
to be fixed strings (don&rsquo;t interpret pattern as a
regular expression).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-P,
--perl-regexp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider the limiting patterns
to be Perl-compatible regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
these types of regular expressions is an optional
compile-time dependency. If Git wasn&rsquo;t compiled with
support for them providing this option will cause it to
die.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--remove-empty</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stop when a given path
disappears from the tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--merges</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print only merge commits. This
is exactly the same as <b>--min-parents=2</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--no-merges</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not print commits with more
than one parent. This is exactly the same as
<b>--max-parents=1</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--min-parents=&lt;number&gt;,
--max-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --no-min-parents,
--no-max-parents</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show only commits which have at
least (or at most) that many parent commits. In particular,
<b>--max-parents=1</b> is the same as <b>--no-merges</b>,
<b>--min-parents=2</b> is the same as <b>--merges</b>.
<b>--max-parents=0</b> gives all root commits and
<b>--min-parents=3</b> all octopus merges.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--no-min-parents</b>
and <b>--no-max-parents</b> reset these limits (to no limit)
again. Equivalent forms are <b>--min-parents=0</b> (any
commit has 0 or more parents) and <b>--max-parents=-1</b>
(negative numbers denote no upper limit).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--first-parent</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Follow only the first parent
commit upon seeing a merge commit. This option can give a
better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular
topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be
only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time,
and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits
brought in to your history by such a merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--not</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reverses the meaning of the
<i>^</i> prefix (or lack thereof) for all following revision
specifiers, up to the next <b>--not</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--all</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all the refs in
<b>refs/</b>, along with <b>HEAD</b>, are listed on the
command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all the refs in
<b>refs/heads</b> are listed on the command line as
<i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given,
limit branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern
lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end
is implied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all the refs in
<b>refs/tags</b> are listed on the command line as
<i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given,
limit tags to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern
lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end
is implied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all the refs in
<b>refs/remotes</b> are listed on the command line as
<i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given,
limit remote-tracking branches to ones matching given shell
glob. If pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>,
<i>/*</i> at the end is implied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all the refs
matching shell glob <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i> are listed
on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. Leading
<i>refs/</i>, is automatically prepended if missing. If
pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at
the end is implied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--exclude=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not include refs matching
<i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i> that the next <b>--all</b>,
<b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, <b>--remotes</b>, or
<b>--glob</b> would otherwise consider. Repetitions of this
option accumulate exclusion patterns up to the next
<b>--all</b>, <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>,
<b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob</b> option (other options or
arguments do not clear accumulated patterns).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The patterns
given should not begin with <b>refs/heads</b>,
<b>refs/tags</b>, or <b>refs/remotes</b> when applied to
<b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, or <b>--remotes</b>,
respectively, and they must begin with <b>refs/</b> when
applied to <b>--glob</b> or <b>--all</b>. If a trailing
<i>/*</i> is intended, it must be given explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--reflog</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all objects
mentioned by reflogs are listed on the command line as
<b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--alternate-refs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all objects
mentioned as ref tips of alternate repositories were listed
on the command line. An alternate repository is any
repository whose object directory is specified in
<b>objects/info/alternates</b>. The set of included objects
may be modified by <b>core.alternateRefsCommand</b>, etc.
See <a href="https://man.page/1/git-config">git-config(1)</a>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--single-worktree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, all working trees
will be examined by the following options when there are
more than one (see <a href="https://man.page/1/git-worktree">git-worktree(1)</a>): <b>--all</b>,
<b>--reflog</b> and <b>--indexed-objects</b>. This option
forces them to examine the current working tree only.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--ignore-missing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Upon seeing an invalid object
name in the input, pretend as if the bad input was not
given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--bisect</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if the bad bisection
ref <b>refs/bisect/bad</b> was listed and as if it was
followed by <b>--not</b> and the good bisection refs
<b>refs/bisect/good-*</b> on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--stdin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In addition to the
<i>&lt;commit&gt;</i> listed on the command line, read them
from the standard input. If a <b>--</b> separator is seen,
stop reading commits and start reading paths to limit the
result.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--cherry-mark</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like <b>--cherry-pick</b> (see
below) but mark equivalent commits with <b>=</b> rather than
omitting them, and inequivalent ones with <b>+</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--cherry-pick</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Omit any commit that introduces
the same change as another commit on the &ldquo;other
side&rdquo; when the set of commits are limited with
symmetric difference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you have two branches, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, a usual way to
list all commits on only one side of them is with
<b>--left-right</b> (see the example below in the
description of the <b>--left-right</b> option). However, it
shows the commits that were cherry-picked from the other
branch (for example, &ldquo;3rd on b&rdquo; may be
cherry-picked from branch A). With this option, such pairs
of commits are excluded from the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--left-only,
--right-only</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List only commits on the
respective side of a symmetric difference, i.e. only those
which would be marked <b>&lt;</b> resp. <b>&gt;</b> by
<b>--left-right</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
<b>--cherry-pick --right-only A...B</b> omits those commits
from <b>B</b> which are in <b>A</b> or are patch-equivalent
to a commit in <b>A</b>. In other words, this lists the
<b>+</b> commits from <b>git cherry A B</b>. More precisely,
<b>--cherry-pick --right-only --no-merges</b> gives the
exact list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--cherry</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A synonym for <b>--right-only
--cherry-mark --no-merges</b>; useful to limit the output to
the commits on our side and mark those that have been
applied to the other side of a forked history with <b>git
log --cherry upstream...mybranch</b>, similar to <b>git
cherry upstream mybranch</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-g,
--walk-reflogs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of walking the commit
ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one
to older ones. When this option is used you cannot specify
commits to exclude (that is, <i>^commit</i>,
<i>commit1..commit2</i>, and <i>commit1...commit2</i>
notations cannot be used).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>--pretty</b> format other than <b>oneline</b> and
<b>reference</b> (for obvious reasons), this causes the
output to have two extra lines of information taken from the
reflog. The reflog designator in the output may be shown as
<b>ref@{Nth}</b> (where <b>Nth</b> is the
reverse-chronological index in the reflog) or as
<b>ref@{timestamp}</b> (with the timestamp for that entry),
depending on a few rules:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">1. If the
starting point is specified as <b>ref@{Nth}</b>, show the
index format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">2. If the
starting point was specified as <b>ref@{now}</b>, show the
timestamp format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">3. If neither
was used, but <b>--date</b> was given on the command line,
show the timestamp in the format requested by
<b>--date</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">4. Otherwise,
show the index format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Under
<b>--pretty=oneline</b>, the commit message is prefixed with
this information on the same line. This option cannot be
combined with <b>--reverse</b>. See also
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-reflog">git-reflog(1)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Under
<b>--pretty=reference</b>, this information will not be
shown at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--merge</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">After a failed merge, show refs
that touch files having a conflict and don&rsquo;t exist on
all heads to merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--boundary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Output excluded boundary
commits. Boundary commits are prefixed with <b>-</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>History
Simplification</b> <br>
Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history,
for example the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;.
But there are two parts of <i>History Simplification</i>,
one part is selecting the commits and the other is how to do
it, as there are various strategies to simplify the
history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options select the commits to be shown:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;paths&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Commits modifying the given
&lt;paths&gt; are selected.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--simplify-by-decoration</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Commits that are referred by
some branch or tag are selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that extra
commits can be shown to give a meaningful history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options affect the way the simplification is performed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Default
mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Simplifies the history to the
simplest history explaining the final state of the tree.
Simplest because it prunes some side branches if the end
result is the same (i.e. merging branches with the same
content)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--show-pulls</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Include all commits from the
default mode, but also any merge commits that are not
TREESAME to the first parent but are TREESAME to a later
parent. This mode is helpful for showing the merge commits
that &quot;first introduced&quot; a change to a branch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--full-history</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as the default mode, but
does not prune some history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--dense</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only the selected commits are
shown, plus some to have a meaningful history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--sparse</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All commits in the simplified

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--simplify-merges</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Additional option to
<b>--full-history</b> to remove some needless merges from
the resulting history, as there are no selected commits
contributing to this merge.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--ancestry-path</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When given a range of commits
to display (e.g. <i>commit1..commit2</i> or <i>commit2
^commit1</i>), only display commits that exist directly on
the ancestry chain between the <i>commit1</i> and
<i>commit2</i>, i.e. commits that are both descendants of
<i>commit1</i>, and ancestors of <i>commit2</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A more detailed
explanation follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Suppose you
specified <b>foo</b> as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall call
commits that modify <b>foo</b> !TREESAME, and the rest
TREESAME. (In a diff filtered for <b>foo</b>, they look
different and equal, respectively.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the
following, we will always refer to the same example history
to illustrate the differences between simplification
settings. We assume that you are filtering for a file
<b>foo</b> in this commit graph:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">.-A---M---N---O---P---Q
<br>
/ / / / / / <br>
I B C D E Y <br>
\ / / / / / <br>
&rsquo;-------------' X</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The horizontal
line of history A---Q is taken to be the first parent of
each merge. The commits are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>I</b>
is the initial commit, in which <b>foo</b> exists with
contents &ldquo;asdf&rdquo;, and a file <b>quux</b> exists
with contents &ldquo;quux&rdquo;. Initial commits are
compared to an empty tree, so <b>I</b> is !TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; In
<b>A</b>, <b>foo</b> contains just &ldquo;foo&rdquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>B</b>
contains the same change as <b>A</b>. Its merge <b>M</b> is
trivial and hence TREESAME to all parents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>C</b>
does not change <b>foo</b>, but its merge <b>N</b> changes
it to &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;, so it is not TREESAME to any
parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>D</b>
sets <b>foo</b> to &ldquo;baz&rdquo;. Its merge <b>O</b>
combines the strings from <b>N</b> and <b>D</b> to
&ldquo;foobarbaz&rdquo;; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any
parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>E</b>
changes <b>quux</b> to &ldquo;xyzzy&rdquo;, and its merge
<b>P</b> combines the strings to &ldquo;quux xyzzy&rdquo;.
<b>P</b> is TREESAME to <b>O</b>, but not to <b>E</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>X</b>
is an independent root commit that added a new file
<b>side</b>, and <b>Y</b> modified it. <b>Y</b> is TREESAME
to <b>X</b>. Its merge <b>Q</b> added <b>side</b> to
<b>P</b>, and <b>Q</b> is TREESAME to <b>P</b>, but not to
<b>Y</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rev-list</b>
walks backwards through history, including or excluding
commits based on whether <b>--full-history</b> and/or parent
rewriting (via <b>--parents</b> or <b>--children</b>) are
used. The following settings are available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Default
mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Commits are included if they
are not TREESAME to any parent (though this can be changed,
see <b>--sparse</b> below). If the commit was a merge, and
it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent.
(Even if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one
of them.) Otherwise, follow all parents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This results
in:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">.-A---N---O
<br>
/ / / <br>
I---------D</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note how the
rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
available, removed <b>B</b> from consideration entirely.
<b>C</b> was considered via <b>N</b>, but is TREESAME. Root
commits are compared to an empty tree, so <b>I</b> is
!TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Parent/child
relations are only visible with <b>--parents</b>, but that
does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we
have shown the parent lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--full-history
without parent rewriting</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This mode differs from the
default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge,
even if it is TREESAME to one of them. Even if more than one
side of the merge has commits that are included, this does
not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we
get</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">I A B N D O P
Q</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>M</b> was
excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents. <b>E</b>,
<b>C</b> and <b>B</b> were all walked, but only <b>B</b> was
!TREESAME, so the others do not appear.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk
about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so
we show them disconnected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--full-history
with parent rewriting</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ordinary commits are only
included if they are !TREESAME (though this can be changed,
see <b>--sparse</b> below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Merges are
always included. However, their parent list is rewritten:
Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included
themselves. This results in</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">.-A---M---N---O---P---Q
<br>
/ / / / / <br>
I B / D / <br>
\ / / / / <br>
&rsquo;-------------'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Compare to
<b>--full-history</b> without rewriting above. Note that
<b>E</b> was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the
parent list of P was rewritten to contain <b>E</b>'s parent
<b>I</b>. The same happened for <b>C</b> and <b>N</b>, and
<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>Q</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME affects
inclusion:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--dense</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Commits that are walked are
included if they are not TREESAME to any parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--sparse</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All commits that are walked are
included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
without <b>--full-history</b>, this still simplifies merges:
if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one,
so the other sides of the merge are never walked.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--simplify-merges</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">First, build a history graph in
the same way that <b>--full-history</b> with parent
rewriting does (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Then simplify
each commit <b>C</b> to its replacement <b>C'</b> in the
final history according to the following rules:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Set
<b>C'</b> to <b>C</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Replace
each parent <b>P</b> of <b>C'</b> with its simplification
<b>P'</b>. In the process, drop parents that are ancestors
of other parents or that are root commits TREESAME to an
empty tree, and remove duplicates, but take care to never
drop all parents that we are TREESAME to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If after
this parent rewriting, <b>C'</b> is a root or merge commit
(has zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or
!TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise, it is replaced with its
only parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The effect of
this is best shown by way of comparing to
<b>--full-history</b> with parent rewriting. The example
turns into:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">.-A---M---N---O
<br>
/ / / <br>
I B D <br>
\ / / <br>
&rsquo;---------'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the major
differences in <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>Q</b> over
<b>--full-history</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>N</b>'s parent list had <b>I</b> removed, because it is
an ancestor of the other parent <b>M</b>. Still, <b>N</b>
remained because it is !TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>P</b>'s parent list similarly had <b>I</b> removed.
<b>P</b> was then removed completely, because it had one
parent and is TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Q</b>'s parent list had <b>Y</b> simplified to <b>X</b>.
<b>X</b> was then removed, because it was a TREESAME root.
<b>Q</b> was then removed completely, because it had one
parent and is TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is
another simplification mode available:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--ancestry-path</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the displayed commits to
those directly on the ancestry chain between the
&ldquo;from&rdquo; and &ldquo;to&rdquo; commits in the given
commit range. I.e. only display commits that are ancestor of
the &ldquo;to&rdquo; commit and descendants of the
&ldquo;from&rdquo; commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As an example
use case, consider the following commit history:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">D---E-------F
<br>
/ \ \ <br>
B---C---G---H---I---J <br>
/ \ <br>
A-------K---------------L--M</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A regular
<i>D..M</i> computes the set of commits that are ancestors
of <b>M</b>, but excludes the ones that are ancestors of
<b>D</b>. This is useful to see what happened to the history
leading to <b>M</b> since <b>D</b>, in the sense that
&ldquo;what does <b>M</b> have that did not exist in
<b>D</b>&rdquo;. The result in this example would be all the
commits, except <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (and <b>D</b> itself,
of course).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When we want to
find out what commits in <b>M</b> are contaminated with the
bug introduced by <b>D</b> and need fixing, however, we
might want to view only the subset of <i>D..M</i> that are
actually descendants of <b>D</b>, i.e. excluding <b>C</b>
and <b>K</b>. This is exactly what the
<b>--ancestry-path</b> option does. Applied to the
<i>D..M</i> range, it results in:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">E-------F <br>
\ \ <br>
G---H---I---J <br>
\ <br>
L--M</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before
discussing another option, <b>--show-pulls</b>, we need to
create a new example history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A common
problem users face when looking at simplified history is
that a commit they know changed a file somehow does not
appear in the file&rsquo;s simplified history. Let&rsquo;s
demonstrate a new example and show how options such as
<b>--full-history</b> and <b>--simplify-merges</b> works in
that case:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">.-A---M-----C--N---O---P
<br>
/ / \ \ \/ / / <br>
I B \ R-'&rsquo;-Z' / <br>
\ / \/ / <br>
\ / /\ / <br>
&rsquo;---X--' &rsquo;---Y--'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For this
example, suppose <b>I</b> created <b>file.txt</b> which was
modified by <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b> in different
ways. The single-parent commits <b>C</b>, <b>Z</b>, and
<b>Y</b> do not change <b>file.txt</b>. The merge commit
<b>M</b> was created by resolving the merge conflict to
include both changes from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and hence is
not TREESAME to either. The merge commit <b>R</b>, however,
was created by ignoring the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at
<b>M</b> and taking only the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at
<b>X</b>. Hence, <b>R</b> is TREESAME to <b>X</b> but not
<b>M</b>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create
<b>N</b> is to take the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at
<b>R</b>, so <b>N</b> is TREESAME to <b>R</b> but not
<b>C</b>. The merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> are
TREESAME to their first parents, but not to their second
parents, <b>Z</b> and <b>Y</b> respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
default mode, <b>N</b> and <b>R</b> both have a TREESAME
parent, so those edges are walked and the others are
ignored. The resulting history graph is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I---X</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using
<b>--full-history</b>, Git walks every edge. This will
discover the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and the merge
<b>M</b>, but also will reveal the merge commits <b>O</b>
and <b>P</b>. With parent rewriting, the resulting graph
is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">.-A---M--------N---O---P
<br>
/ / \ \ \/ / / <br>
I B \ R-'&rsquo;--' / <br>
\ / \/ / <br>
\ / /\ / <br>
&rsquo;---X--' &rsquo;------'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here, the merge
commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> contribute extra noise, as
they did not actually contribute a change to
<b>file.txt</b>. They only merged a topic that was based on
an older version of <b>file.txt</b>. This is a common issue
in repositories using a workflow where many contributors
work in parallel and merge their topic branches along a
single trunk: manu unrelated merges appear in the
<b>--full-history</b> results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
<b>--simplify-merges</b> option, the commits <b>O</b> and
<b>P</b> disappear from the results. This is because the
rewritten second parents of <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> are
reachable from their first parents. Those edges are removed
and then the commits look like single-parent commits that
are TREESAME to their parent. This also happens to the
commit <b>N</b>, resulting in a history view as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">.-A---M--. <br>
/ / \ <br>
I B R <br>
\ / / <br>
\ / / <br>
&rsquo;---X--'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this view,
we see all of the important single-parent changes from
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b>. We also see the
carefully-resolved merge <b>M</b> and the
not-so-carefully-resolved merge <b>R</b>. This is usually
enough information to determine why the commits <b>A</b> and
<b>B</b> &quot;disappeared&quot; from history in the default
view. However, there are a few issues with this
approach.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first issue
is performance. Unlike any previous option, the
<b>--simplify-merges</b> option requires walking the entire
commit history before returning a single result. This can
make the option difficult to use for very large
repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are working
on the same repository, it is important which merge commits
introduced a change into an important branch. The
problematic merge <b>R</b> above is not likely to be the
merge commit that was used to merge into an important
branch. Instead, the merge <b>N</b> was used to merge
<b>R</b> and <b>X</b> into the important branch. This commit
may have information about why the change <b>X</b> came to
override the changes from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> in its
commit message.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--show-pulls</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In addition to the commits
shown in the default history, show each merge commit that is
not TREESAME to its first parent but is TREESAME to a later
parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When a merge
commit is included by <b>--show-pulls</b>, the merge is
treated as if it &quot;pulled&quot; the change from another
branch. When using <b>--show-pulls</b> on this example (and
no other options) the resulting graph is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">I---X---R---N</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here, the merge
commits <b>R</b> and <b>N</b> are included because they
pulled the commits <b>X</b> and <b>R</b> into the base
branch, respectively. These merges are the reason the
commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> do not appear in the default
history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>--show-pulls</b> is paired with <b>--simplify-merges</b>,
the graph includes all of the necessary information:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">.-A---M--. N
<br>
/ / \ / <br>
I B R <br>
\ / / <br>
\ / / <br>
&rsquo;---X--'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Notice that
since <b>M</b> is reachable from <b>R</b>, the edge from
<b>N</b> to <b>M</b> was simplified away. However, <b>N</b>
still appears in the history as an important commit because
it &quot;pulled&quot; the change <b>R</b> into the main
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>--simplify-by-decoration</b> option allows you to view
only the big picture of the topology of the history, by
omitting commits that are not referenced by tags. Commits
are marked as !TREESAME (in other words, kept after history
simplification rules described above) if (1) they are
referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the
paths given on the command line. All other commits are
marked as TREESAME (subject to be simplified away).</p>
