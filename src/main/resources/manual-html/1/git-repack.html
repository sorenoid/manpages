<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-repack -
Pack unpacked objects in a repository</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
repack</i> [-a] [-A] [-d] [-f] [-F] [-l] [-n] [-q] [-b] [-m]
[--window=&lt;n&gt;] [--depth=&lt;n&gt;]
[--threads=&lt;n&gt;] [--keep-pack=&lt;pack-name&gt;]
[--write-midx]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command is
used to combine all objects that do not currently reside in
a &quot;pack&quot;, into a pack. It can also be used to
re-organize existing packs into a single, more efficient
pack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A pack is a
collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta
compression applied, stored in a single file, with an
associated index file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Packs are used
to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk
storage, etc.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-a</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of incrementally
packing the unpacked objects, pack everything referenced
into a single pack. Especially useful when packing a
repository that is used for private development. Use with
<b>-d</b>. This will clean up the objects that <b>git
prune</b> leaves behind, but <b>git fsck --full
--dangling</b> shows as dangling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that users
fetching over dumb protocols will have to fetch the whole
new pack in order to get any contained object, no matter how
many other objects in that pack they already have
locally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Promisor
packfiles are repacked separately: if there are packfiles
that have an associated &quot;.promisor&quot; file, these
packfiles will be repacked into another separate pack, and
an empty &quot;.promisor&quot; file corresponding to the new
separate pack will be written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-A</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as <b>-a</b>, unless
<b>-d</b> is used. Then any unreachable objects in a
previous pack become loose, unpacked objects, instead of
being left in the old pack. Unreachable objects are never
intentionally added to a pack, even when repacking. This
option prevents unreachable objects from being immediately
deleted by way of being left in the old pack and then
removed. Instead, the loose unreachable objects will be
pruned according to normal expiry rules with the next <i>git
gc</i> invocation. See <b>git-gc</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">After packing, if the newly
created packs make some existing packs redundant, remove the
redundant packs. Also run <i>git prune-packed</i> to remove
redundant loose object files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-l</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass the <b>--local</b> option
to <i>git pack-objects</i>. See
<b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-f</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass the
<b>--no-reuse-delta</b> option to <b>git-pack-objects</b>,
see <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-F</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass the
<b>--no-reuse-object</b> option to <b>git-pack-objects</b>,
see <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-q</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass the <b>-q</b> option to
<i>git pack-objects</i>. See <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-n</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not update the server
information with <i>git update-server-info</i>. This option
skips updating local catalog files needed to publish this
repository (or a direct copy of it) over HTTP or FTP. See
<b>git-update-server-info</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--window=&lt;n&gt;,
--depth=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These two options affect how
the objects contained in the pack are stored using delta
compression. The objects are first internally sorted by
type, size and optionally names and compared against the
other objects within <b>--window</b> to see if using delta
compression saves space. <b>--depth</b> limits the maximum
delta depth; making it too deep affects the performance on
the unpacker side, because delta data needs to be applied
that many times to get to the necessary object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value for --window is 10 and --depth is 50. The maximum
depth is 4095.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--threads=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option is passed through
to <b>git pack-objects</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--window-memory=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option provides an
additional limit on top of <b>--window</b>; the window size
will dynamically scale down so as to not take up more than
<i>&lt;n&gt;</i> bytes in memory. This is useful in
repositories with a mix of large and small objects to not
run out of memory with a large window, but still be able to
take advantage of the large window for the smaller objects.
The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;,
or &quot;g&quot;. <b>--window-memory=0</b> makes memory
usage unlimited. The default is taken from the
<b>pack.windowMemory</b> configuration variable. Note that
the actual memory usage will be the limit multiplied by the
number of threads used by <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--max-pack-size=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Maximum size of each output
pack file. The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;,
&quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. The minimum size allowed is
limited to 1 MiB. If specified, multiple packfiles may be
created, which also prevents the creation of a bitmap index.
The default is unlimited, unless the config variable
<b>pack.packSizeLimit</b> is set. Note that this option may
result in a larger and slower repository; see the discussion
in <b>pack.packSizeLimit</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-b,
--write-bitmap-index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write a reachability bitmap
index as part of the repack. This only makes sense when used
with <b>-a</b>, <b>-A</b> or <b>-m</b>, as the bitmaps must
be able to refer to all reachable objects. This option
overrides the setting of <b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>. This
option has no effect if multiple packfiles are created,
unless writing a MIDX (in which case a multi-pack bitmap is
created).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--pack-kept-objects</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Include objects in <b>.keep</b>
files when repacking. Note that we still do not delete
<b>.keep</b> packs after <b>pack-objects</b> finishes. This
means that we may duplicate objects, but this makes the
option safe to use when there are concurrent pushes or
fetches. This option is generally only useful if you are
writing bitmaps with <b>-b</b> or
<b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>, as it ensures that the bitmapped
packfile has the necessary objects.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--keep-pack=&lt;pack-name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Exclude the given pack from
repacking. This is the equivalent of having <b>.keep</b>
file on the pack. <b>&lt;pack-name&gt;</b> is the pack file
name without leading directory (e.g. <b>pack-123.pack</b>).
The option could be specified multiple times to keep
multiple packs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--unpack-unreachable=&lt;when&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When loosening unreachable
objects, do not bother loosening any objects older than
<b>&lt;when&gt;</b>. This can be used to optimize out the
write of any objects that would be immediately pruned by a
follow-up <b>git prune</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-k,
--keep-unreachable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>-ad</b>, any
unreachable objects from existing packs will be appended to
the end of the packfile instead of being removed. In
addition, any unreachable loose objects will be packed (and
their loose counterparts removed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-i,
--delta-islands</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass the <b>--delta-islands</b>
option to <b>git-pack-objects</b>, see
<b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-g=&lt;factor&gt;,
--geometric=&lt;factor&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Arrange resulting pack
structure so that each successive pack contains at least
<b>&lt;factor&gt;</b> times the number of objects as the
next-largest pack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git
repack</b> ensures this by determining a &quot;cut&quot; of
packfiles that need to be repacked into one in order to
ensure a geometric progression. It picks the smallest set of
packfiles such that as many of the larger packfiles (by
count of objects contained in that pack) may be left
intact.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike other
repack modes, the set of objects to pack is determined
uniquely by the set of packs being &quot;rolled-up&quot;; in
other words, the packs determined to need to be combined in
order to restore a geometric progression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>--unpacked</b> is specified, loose objects are implicitly
included in this &quot;roll-up&quot;, without respect to
their reachability. This is subject to change in the future.
This option (implying a drastically different repack mode)
is not guaranteed to work with all other combinations of
option to <b>git repack</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When writing a
multi-pack bitmap, <b>git repack</b> selects the largest
resulting pack as the preferred pack for object selection by
the MIDX (see <b>git-multi-pack-index</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-m,
--write-midx</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write a multi-pack index (see
<b>git-multi-pack-index</b>(1)) containing the non-redundant
packs.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various
configuration variables affect packing, see
<b>git-config</b>(1) (search for &quot;pack&quot; and
&quot;delta&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
command passes <b>--delta-base-offset</b> option to <i>git
pack-objects</i>; this typically results in slightly smaller
packs, but the generated packs are incompatible with
versions of Git older than version 1.4.4. If you need to
share your repository with such ancient Git versions, either
directly or via the dumb http protocol, then you need to set
the configuration variable <b>repack.UseDeltaBaseOffset</b>
to &quot;false&quot; and repack. Access from old Git
versions over the native protocol is unaffected by this
option as the conversion is performed on the fly as needed
in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Delta
compression is not used on objects larger than the
<b>core.bigFileThreshold</b> configuration variable and on
files with the attribute <b>delta</b> set to false.</p>
