<h2>WARNING
<a name="WARNING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
filter-branch</i> has a plethora of pitfalls that can
produce non-obvious manglings of the intended history
rewrite (and can leave you with little time to investigate
such problems since it has such abysmal performance). These
safety and performance issues cannot be backward compatibly
fixed and as such, its use is not recommended. Please use an
alternative history filtering tool such as
<b><font color="#0000FF">git filter-repo</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">. If you still need to use <i>git
filter-branch</i>, please carefully read the section called
&ldquo;SAFETY&rdquo; (and the section called
&ldquo;PERFORMANCE&rdquo;) to learn about the land mines of
filter-branch, and then vigilantly avoid as many of the
hazards listed there as reasonably possible.</font></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Lets
you rewrite Git revision history by rewriting the branches
mentioned in the &lt;rev-list options&gt;, applying custom
filters on each revision. Those filters can modify each tree
(e.g. removing a file or running a perl rewrite on all
files) or information about each commit. Otherwise, all
information (including original commit times or merge
information) will be preserved.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
command will only rewrite the <i>positive</i> refs mentioned
in the command line (e.g. if you pass <i>a..b</i>, only
<i>b</i> will be rewritten). If you specify no filters, the
commits will be recommitted without any changes, which would
normally have no effect. Nevertheless, this may be useful in
the future for compensating for some Git bugs or such,
therefore such a usage is permitted.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>NOTE</b>:
This command honors <b>.git/info/grafts</b> file and refs in
the <b>refs/replace/</b> namespace. If you have any grafts
or replacement refs defined, running this command will make
them permanent.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>WARNING</b>!
The rewritten history will have different object names for
all the objects and will not converge with the original
branch. You will not be able to easily push and distribute
the rewritten branch on top of the original branch. Please
do not use this command if you do not know the full
implications, and avoid using it anyway, if a simple single
commit would suffice to fix your problem. (See the
&quot;RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE&quot; section in
<b>git-rebase</b>(1) for further information about rewriting
published history.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Always
verify that the rewritten version is correct: The original
refs, if different from the rewritten ones, will be stored
in the namespace <i>refs/original/</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that since this operation is very I/O expensive, it might be
a good idea to redirect the temporary directory off-disk
with the <b>-d</b> option, e.g. on tmpfs. Reportedly the
speedup is very noticeable.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Filters</b>
<br>
The filters are applied in the order as listed below. The
&lt;command&gt; argument is always evaluated in the shell
context using the <i>eval</i> command (with the notable
exception of the commit filter, for technical reasons).
Prior to that, the <b>$GIT_COMMIT</b> environment variable
will be set to contain the id of the commit being rewritten.
Also, GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE,
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, and
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE are taken from the current commit and
exported to the environment, in order to affect the author
and committer identities of the replacement commit created
by <b>git-commit-tree</b>(1) after the filters have
run.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
any evaluation of &lt;command&gt; returns a non-zero exit
status, the whole operation will be aborted.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">A
<i>map</i> function is available that takes an
&quot;original sha1 id&quot; argument and outputs a
&quot;rewritten sha1 id&quot; if the commit has been already
rewritten, and &quot;original sha1 id&quot; otherwise; the
<i>map</i> function can return several ids on separate lines
if your commit filter emitted multiple commits.</font></p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--setup
&lt;command&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This is
not a real filter executed for each commit but a one time
setup just before the loop. Therefore no commit-specific
variables are defined yet. Functions or variables defined
here can be used or modified in the following filter steps
except the commit filter, for technical reasons.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--subdirectory-filter
&lt;directory&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Only look
at the history which touches the given subdirectory. The
result will contain that directory (and only that) as its
project root. Implies the section called &ldquo;Remap to
ancestor&rdquo;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--env-filter
&lt;command&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
filter may be used if you only need to modify the
environment in which the commit will be performed.
Specifically, you might want to rewrite the author/committer
name/email/time environment variables (see
<b>git-commit-tree</b>(1) for details).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--tree-filter
&lt;command&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This is
the filter for rewriting the tree and its contents. The
argument is evaluated in shell with the working directory
set to the root of the checked out tree. The new tree is
then used as-is (new files are auto-added, disappeared files
are auto-removed - neither .gitignore files nor any other
ignore rules <b>HAVE ANY EFFECT</b>!).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--index-filter
&lt;command&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This is
the filter for rewriting the index. It is similar to the
tree filter but does not check out the tree, which makes it
much faster. Frequently used with <b>git rm --cached
--ignore-unmatch ...</b>, see EXAMPLES below. For hairy
cases, see <b>git-update-index</b>(1).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--parent-filter
&lt;command&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This is
the filter for rewriting the commit&rsquo;s parent list. It
will receive the parent string on stdin and shall output the
new parent string on stdout. The parent string is in the
format described in <b>git-commit-tree</b>(1): empty for the
initial commit, &quot;-p parent&quot; for a normal commit
and &quot;-p parent1 -p parent2 -p parent3 ...&quot; for a
merge commit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--msg-filter
&lt;command&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This is
the filter for rewriting the commit messages. The argument
is evaluated in the shell with the original commit message
on standard input; its standard output is used as the new
commit message.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--commit-filter
&lt;command&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This is
the filter for performing the commit. If this filter is
specified, it will be called instead of the <i>git
commit-tree</i> command, with arguments of the form
&quot;&lt;TREE_ID&gt; [(-p
&lt;PARENT_COMMIT_ID&gt;)...]&quot; and the log message on
stdin. The commit id is expected on stdout.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">As
a special extension, the commit filter may emit multiple
commit ids; in that case, the rewritten children of the
original commit will have all of them as parents.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">You
can use the <i>map</i> convenience function in this filter,
and other convenience functions, too. For example, calling
<i>skip_commit &quot;$@&quot;</i> will leave out the current
commit (but not its changes! If you want that, use <i>git
rebase</i> instead).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">You
can also use the <b>git_commit_non_empty_tree
&quot;$@&quot;</b> instead of <b>git commit-tree
&quot;$@&quot;</b> if you don&rsquo;t wish to keep commits
with a single parent and that makes no change to the
tree.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--tag-name-filter
&lt;command&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This is
the filter for rewriting tag names. When passed, it will be
called for every tag ref that points to a rewritten object
(or to a tag object which points to a rewritten object). The
original tag name is passed via standard input, and the new
tag name is expected on standard output.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
original tags are not deleted, but can be overwritten; use
&quot;--tag-name-filter cat&quot; to simply update the tags.
In this case, be very careful and make sure you have the old
tags backed up in case the conversion has run
afoul.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nearly
proper rewriting of tag objects is supported. If the tag has
a message attached, a new tag object will be created with
the same message, author, and timestamp. If the tag has a
signature attached, the signature will be stripped. It is by
definition impossible to preserve signatures. The reason
this is &quot;nearly&quot; proper, is because ideally if the
tag did not change (points to the same object, has the same
name, etc.) it should retain any signature. That is not the
case, signatures will always be removed, buyer beware. There
is also no support for changing the author or timestamp (or
the tag message for that matter). Tags which point to other
tags will be rewritten to point to the underlying
commit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--prune-empty</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Some
filters will generate empty commits that leave the tree
untouched. This option instructs git-filter-branch to remove
such commits if they have exactly one or zero non-pruned
parents; merge commits will therefore remain intact. This
option cannot be used together with <b>--commit-filter</b>,
though the same effect can be achieved by using the provided
<b>git_commit_non_empty_tree</b> function in a commit
filter.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--original
&lt;namespace&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Use this
option to set the namespace where the original commits will
be stored. The default value is
<i>refs/original</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">-d
&lt;directory&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Use this
option to set the path to the temporary directory used for
rewriting. When applying a tree filter, the command needs to
temporarily check out the tree to some directory, which may
consume considerable space in case of large projects. By
default it does this in the <b>.git-rewrite/</b> directory
but you can override that choice by this
parameter.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">-f,
--force</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000"><i>git
filter-branch</i> refuses to start with an existing
temporary directory or when there are already refs starting
with <i>refs/original/</i>, unless forced.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">--state-branch
&lt;branch&gt;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option will cause the mapping from old to new objects to be
loaded from named branch upon startup and saved as a new
commit to that branch upon exit, enabling incremental of
large trees. If <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i> does not exist it will
be created.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&lt;rev-list
options&gt;...</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Arguments
for <i>git rev-list</i>. All positive refs included by these
options are rewritten. You may also specify options such as
<b>--all</b>, but you must use <b>--</b> to separate them
from the <i>git filter-branch</i> options. Implies the
section called &ldquo;Remap to ancestor&rdquo;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Remap
to ancestor</b> <br>
By using <b>git-rev-list</b>(1) arguments, e.g., path
limiters, you can limit the set of revisions which get
rewritten. However, positive refs on the command line are
distinguished: we don&rsquo;t let them be excluded by such
limiters. For this purpose, they are instead rewritten to
point at the nearest ancestor that was not
excluded.</font></p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">On
success, the exit status is <b>0</b>. If the filter
can&rsquo;t find any commits to rewrite, the exit status is
<b>2</b>. On any other error, the exit status may be any
other non-zero value.</font></p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Suppose
you want to remove a file (containing confidential
information or copyright violation) from all
commits:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm filename' HEAD</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">However,
if the file is absent from the tree of some commit, a simple
<b>rm filename</b> will fail for that tree and commit. Thus
you may instead want to use <b>rm -f filename</b> as the
script.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Using
<b>--index-filter</b> with <i>git rm</i> yields a
significantly faster version. Like with using <b>rm
filename</b>, <b>git rm --cached filename</b> will fail if
the file is absent from the tree of a commit. If you want to
&quot;completely forget&quot; a file, it does not matter
when it entered history, so we also add
<b>--ignore-unmatch</b>:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached
--ignore-unmatch filename' HEAD</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Now,
you will get the rewritten history saved in HEAD.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
rewrite the repository to look as if <b>foodir/</b> had been
its project root, and discard all other history:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch --subdirectory-filter foodir --
--all</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Thus
you can, e.g., turn a library subdirectory into a repository
of its own. Note the <b>--</b> that separates
<i>filter-branch</i> options from revision options, and the
<b>--all</b> to rewrite all branches and tags.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
set a commit (which typically is at the tip of another
history) to be the parent of the current initial commit, in
order to paste the other history behind the current
history:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch --parent-filter 'sed &quot;s/^\$/-p
&lt;graft-id&gt;/&quot;' HEAD</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">(if
the parent string is empty - which happens when we are
dealing with the initial commit - add graftcommit as a
parent). Note that this assumes history with a single root
(that is, no merge without common ancestors happened). If
this is not the case, use:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch --parent-filter \ <br>
'test $GIT_COMMIT = &lt;commit-id&gt; &amp;&amp; echo
&quot;-p &lt;graft-id&gt;&quot; || cat' HEAD</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">or
even simpler:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
replace --graft $commit-id $graft-id <br>
git filter-branch $graft-id..HEAD</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
remove commits authored by &quot;Darl McBribe&quot; from the
history:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch --commit-filter ' <br>
if [ &quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME&quot; = &quot;Darl McBribe&quot;
]; <br>
then <br>
skip_commit &quot;$@&quot;; <br>
else <br>
git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot;; <br>
fi' HEAD</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
function <i>skip_commit</i> is defined as
follows:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">skip_commit()
<br>
{ <br>
shift; <br>
while [ -n &quot;$1&quot; ]; <br>
do <br>
shift; <br>
map &quot;$1&quot;; <br>
shift; <br>
done; <br>
}</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
shift magic first throws away the tree id and then the -p
parameters. Note that this handles merges properly! In case
Darl committed a merge between P1 and P2, it will be
propagated properly and all children of the merge will
become merge commits with P1,P2 as their parents instead of
the merge commit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>NOTE</b>
the changes introduced by the commits, and which are not
reverted by subsequent commits, will still be in the
rewritten branch. If you want to throw out <i>changes</i>
together with the commits, you should use the interactive
mode of <i>git rebase</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">You
can rewrite the commit log messages using
<b>--msg-filter</b>. For example, <i>git svn-id</i> strings
in a repository created by <i>git svn</i> can be removed
this way:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch --msg-filter ' <br>
sed -e &quot;/^git-svn-id:/d&quot; <br>
'</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
you need to add <i>Acked-by</i> lines to, say, the last 10
commits (none of which is a merge), use this
command:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch --msg-filter ' <br>
cat &amp;&amp; <br>
echo &quot;Acked-by: Bugs Bunny
&lt;bunny@bugzilla.org&gt;&quot; <br>
' HEAD~10..HEAD</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<b>--env-filter</b> option can be used to modify committer
and/or author identity. For example, if you found out that
your commits have the wrong identity due to a misconfigured
user.email, you can make a correction, before publishing the
project, like this:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch --env-filter ' <br>
if test &quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL&quot; =
&quot;root@localhost&quot; <br>
then <br>
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=john@example.com <br>
fi <br>
if test &quot;$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL&quot; =
&quot;root@localhost&quot; <br>
then <br>
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=john@example.com <br>
fi <br>
' -- --all</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
restrict rewriting to only part of the history, specify a
revision range in addition to the new branch name. The new
branch name will point to the top-most revision that a
<i>git rev-list</i> of this range will print.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Consider
this history:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">D--E--F--G--H
<br>
/ / <br>
A--B-----C</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
rewrite only commits D,E,F,G,H, but leave A, B and C alone,
use:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch ... C..H</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
rewrite commits E,F,G,H, use one of these:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git
filter-branch ... C..H --not D <br>
git filter-branch ... D..H --not C</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
move the whole tree into a subdirectory, or remove it from
there:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git

<h2>CHECKLIST FOR SHRINKING A REPOSITORY
<a name="CHECKLIST FOR SHRINKING A REPOSITORY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git-filter-branch
can be used to get rid of a subset of files, usually with
some combination of <b>--index-filter</b> and
<b>--subdirectory-filter</b>. People expect the resulting
repository to be smaller than the original, but you need a
few more steps to actually make it smaller, because Git
tries hard not to lose your objects until you tell it to.
First make sure that:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
You really removed all variants of a filename, if a blob was
moved over its lifetime. <b>git log --name-only --follow
--all -- filename</b> can help you find renames.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
You really filtered all refs: use <b>--tag-name-filter cat
-- --all</b> when calling git-filter-branch.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Then
there are two ways to get a smaller repository. A safer way
is to clone, that keeps your original intact.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Clone it with <b>git clone file:///path/to/repo</b>. The
clone will not have the removed objects. See
<b>git-clone</b>(1). (Note that cloning with a plain path
just hardlinks everything!)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
you really don&rsquo;t want to clone it, for whatever
reasons, check the following points instead (in this order).
This is a very destructive approach, so <b>make a backup</b>
or go back to cloning it. You have been warned.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Remove the original refs backed up by git-filter-branch: say
<b>git for-each-ref --format=&quot;%(refname)&quot;
refs/original/ | xargs -n 1 git update-ref
-d</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Expire all reflogs with <b>git reflog expire --expire=now
--all</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Garbage collect all unreferenced objects with <b>git gc
--prune=now</b> (or if your git-gc is not new enough to
support arguments to <b>--prune</b>, use <b>git repack -ad;
git prune</b> instead).</font></p>

<h2>PERFORMANCE
<a name="PERFORMANCE"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
performance of git-filter-branch is glacially slow; its
design makes it impossible for a backward-compatible
implementation to ever be fast:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
In editing files, git-filter-branch by design checks out
each and every commit as it existed in the original repo. If
your repo has <b>10^5</b> files and <b>10^5</b> commits, but
each commit only modifies five files, then git-filter-branch
will make you do <b>10^10</b> modifications, despite only
having (at most) <b>5*10^5</b> unique blobs.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If you try and cheat and try to make git-filter-branch only
work on files modified in a commit, then two things
happen</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
you run into problems with deletions whenever the user is
simply trying to rename files (because attempting to delete
files that don&rsquo;t exist looks like a no-op; it takes
some chicanery to remap deletes across file renames when the
renames happen via arbitrary user-provided shell)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
even if you succeed at the map-deletes-for-renames
chicanery, you still technically violate backward
compatibility because users are allowed to filter files in
ways that depend upon topology of commits instead of
filtering solely based on file contents or names (though
this has not been observed in the wild).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Even if you don&rsquo;t need to edit files but only want to
e.g. rename or remove some and thus can avoid checking out
each file (i.e. you can use --index-filter), you still are
passing shell snippets for your filters. This means that for
every commit, you have to have a prepared git repo where
those filters can be run. That&rsquo;s a significant
setup.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Further, several additional files are created or updated per
commit by git-filter-branch. Some of these are for
supporting the convenience functions provided by
git-filter-branch (such as map()), while others are for
keeping track of internal state (but could have also been
accessed by user filters; one of git-filter-branch&rsquo;s
regression tests does so). This essentially amounts to using
the filesystem as an IPC mechanism between git-filter-branch
and the user-provided filters. Disks tend to be a slow IPC
mechanism, and writing these files also effectively
represents a forced synchronization point between separate
processes that we hit with every commit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The user-provided shell commands will likely involve a
pipeline of commands, resulting in the creation of many
processes per commit. Creating and running another process
takes a widely varying amount of time between operating
systems, but on any platform it is very slow relative to
invoking a function.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
git-filter-branch itself is written in shell, which is kind
of slow. This is the one performance issue that could be
backward-compatibly fixed, but compared to the above
problems that are intrinsic to the design of
git-filter-branch, the language of the tool itself is a
relatively minor issue.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Side note: Unfortunately, people tend to fixate on the
written-in-shell aspect and periodically ask if
git-filter-branch could be rewritten in another language to
fix the performance issues. Not only does that ignore the
bigger intrinsic problems with the design, it&rsquo;d help
less than you&rsquo;d expect: if git-filter-branch itself
were not shell, then the convenience functions (map(),
skip_commit(), etc) and the <b>--setup</b> argument could no
longer be executed once at the beginning of the program but
would instead need to be prepended to every user filter (and
thus re-executed with every commit).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">git filter-repo</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">tool is an alternative to
git-filter-branch which does not suffer from these
performance problems or the safety problems (mentioned
below). For those with existing tooling which relies upon

<b><font color="#0000FF">filter-lamely</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[2]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">, a drop-in git-filter-branch
replacement (with a few caveats). While filter-lamely
suffers from all the same safety issues as
git-filter-branch, it at least ameliorates the performance
issues a little.</font></p>

<h2>SAFETY
<a name="SAFETY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">git-filter-branch
is riddled with gotchas resulting in various ways to easily
corrupt repos or end up with a mess worse than what you
started with:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Someone can have a set of &quot;working and tested
filters&quot; which they document or provide to a coworker,
who then runs them on a different OS where the same commands
are not working/tested (some examples in the
git-filter-branch manpage are also affected by this). BSD
vs. GNU userland differences can really bite. If lucky,
error messages are spewed. But just as likely, the commands
either don&rsquo;t do the filtering requested, or silently
corrupt by making some unwanted change. The unwanted change
may only affect a few commits, so it&rsquo;s not necessarily
obvious either. (The fact that problems won&rsquo;t
necessarily be obvious means they are likely to go unnoticed
until the rewritten history is in use for quite a while, at
which point it&rsquo;s really hard to justify another
flag-day for another rewrite.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Filenames with spaces are often mishandled by shell snippets
since they cause problems for shell pipelines. Not everyone
is familiar with find -print0, xargs -0, git-ls-files -z,
etc. Even people who are familiar with these may assume such
flags are not relevant because someone else renamed any such
files in their repo back before the person doing the
filtering joined the project. And often, even those familiar
with handling arguments with spaces may not do so just
because they aren&rsquo;t in the mindset of thinking about
everything that could possibly go wrong.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Non-ascii filenames can be silently removed despite being in
a desired directory. Keeping only wanted paths is often done
using pipelines like <b>git ls-files | grep -v ^WANTED_DIR/
| xargs git rm</b>. ls-files will only quote filenames if
needed, so folks may not notice that one of the files
didn&rsquo;t match the regex (at least not until it&rsquo;s
much too late). Yes, someone who knows about core.quotePath
can avoid this (unless they have other special characters
like \t, \n, or &quot;), and people who use ls-files -z with
something other than grep can avoid this, but that
doesn&rsquo;t mean they will.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Similarly, when moving files around, one can find that
filenames with non-ascii or special characters end up in a
different directory, one that includes a double quote
character. (This is technically the same issue as above with
quoting, but perhaps an interesting different way that it
can and has manifested as a problem.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
It&rsquo;s far too easy to accidentally mix up old and new
history. It&rsquo;s still possible with any tool, but
git-filter-branch almost invites it. If lucky, the only
downside is users getting frustrated that they don&rsquo;t
know how to shrink their repo and remove the old stuff. If
unlucky, they merge old and new history and end up with
multiple &quot;copies&quot; of each commit, some of which
have unwanted or sensitive files and others which
don&rsquo;t. This comes about in multiple different
ways:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
the default to only doing a partial history rewrite
(<i>--all</i> is not the default and few examples show
it)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
the fact that there&rsquo;s no automatic post-run
cleanup</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
the fact that --tag-name-filter (when used to rename tags)
doesn&rsquo;t remove the old tags but just adds new ones
with the new name</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
the fact that little educational information is provided to
inform users of the ramifications of a rewrite and how to
avoid mixing old and new history. For example, this man page
discusses how users need to understand that they need to
rebase their changes for all their branches on top of new
history (or delete and reclone), but that&rsquo;s only one
of multiple concerns to consider. See the
&quot;DISCUSSION&quot; section of the git filter-repo manual
page for more details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Annotated tags can be accidentally converted to lightweight
tags, due to either of two issues:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Someone can do a history rewrite, realize they messed up,
restore from the backups in refs/original/, and then redo
their git-filter-branch command. (The backup in
refs/original/ is not a real backup; it dereferences tags
first.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Running git-filter-branch with either --tags or --all in
your &lt;rev-list options&gt;. In order to retain annotated
tags as annotated, you must use --tag-name-filter (and must
not have restored from refs/original/ in a previously
botched rewrite).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Any commit messages that specify an encoding will become
corrupted by the rewrite; git-filter-branch ignores the
encoding, takes the original bytes, and feeds it to
commit-tree without telling it the proper encoding. (This
happens whether or not --msg-filter is used.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Commit messages (even if they are all UTF-8) by default
become corrupted due to not being updated &mdash; any
references to other commit hashes in commit messages will
now refer to no-longer-extant commits.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
There are no facilities for helping users find what unwanted
crud they should delete, which means they are much more
likely to have incomplete or partial cleanups that sometimes
result in confusion and people wasting time trying to
understand. (For example, folks tend to just look for big
files to delete instead of big directories or extensions,
and once they do so, then sometime later folks using the new
repository who are going through history will notice a build
artifact directory that has some files but not others, or a
cache of dependencies (node_modules or similar) which
couldn&rsquo;t have ever been functional since it&rsquo;s
missing some files.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If --prune-empty isn&rsquo;t specified, then the filtering
process can create hoards of confusing empty
commits</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If --prune-empty is specified, then intentionally placed
empty commits from before the filtering operation are also
pruned instead of just pruning commits that became empty due
to filtering rules.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If --prune-empty is specified, sometimes empty commits are
missed and left around anyway (a somewhat rare bug, but it
happens...)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
A minor issue, but users who have a goal to update all names
and emails in a repository may be led to --env-filter which
will only update authors and committers, missing
taggers.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If the user provides a --tag-name-filter that maps multiple
tags to the same name, no warning or error is provided;
git-filter-branch simply overwrites each tag in some
undocumented pre-defined order resulting in only one tag at
the end. (A git-filter-branch regression test requires this
surprising behavior.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Also,
the poor performance of git-filter-branch often leads to
safety issues:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Coming up with the correct shell snippet to do the filtering
you want is sometimes difficult unless you&rsquo;re just
doing a trivial modification such as deleting a couple
files. Unfortunately, people often learn if the snippet is
right or wrong by trying it out, but the rightness or
wrongness can vary depending on special circumstances
(spaces in filenames, non-ascii filenames, funny author
names or emails, invalid timezones, presence of grafts or
replace objects, etc.), meaning they may have to wait a long
time, hit an error, then restart. The performance of
git-filter-branch is so bad that this cycle is painful,
reducing the time available to carefully re-check (to say
nothing about what it does to the patience of the person
doing the rewrite even if they do technically have more time
available). This problem is extra compounded because errors
from broken filters may not be shown for a long time and/or
get lost in a sea of output. Even worse, broken filters
often just result in silent incorrect rewrites.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
To top it all off, even when users finally find working
commands, they naturally want to share them. But they may be
unaware that their repo didn&rsquo;t have some special cases
that someone else&rsquo;s does. So, when someone else with a
different repository runs the same commands, they get hit by
the problems above. Or, the user just runs commands that
really were vetted for special cases, but they run it on a
different OS where it doesn&rsquo;t work, as noted
above.</font></p>
