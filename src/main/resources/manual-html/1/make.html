<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">make - GNU make
utility to maintain groups of programs</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>make</b>
[<i>OPTION</i>]... [<i>TARGET</i>]...</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>make</i>
utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large
program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to
recompile them. The manual describes the GNU implementation
of <b>make</b>, which was written by Richard Stallman and
Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by Paul Smith.
Our examples show C programs, since they are very common,
but you can use <b>make</b> with any programming language
whose compiler can be run with a shell command. In fact,
<b>make</b> is not limited to programs. You can use it to
describe any task where some files must be updated
automatically from others whenever the others change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To prepare to
use <b>make</b>, you must write a file called the
<i>makefile</i> that describes the relationships among files
in your program, and the states the commands for updating
each file. In a program, typically the executable file is
updated from object files, which are in turn made by
compiling source files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once a suitable
makefile exists, each time you change some source files,
this simple shell command:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>make</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">suffices to
perform all necessary recompilations. The <b>make</b>
program uses the makefile description and the
last-modification times of the files to decide which of the
files need to be updated. For each of those files, it issues
the commands recorded in the makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>make</b>
executes commands in the <i>makefile</i> to update one or
more target <i>names</i>, where <i>name</i> is typically a
program. If no <b>-f</b> option is present, <b>make</b> will
look for the makefiles <i>GNUmakefile</i>, <i>makefile</i>,
and <i>Makefile</i>, in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally you
should call your makefile either <i>makefile</i> or
<i>Makefile</i>. (We recommend <i>Makefile</i> because it
appears prominently near the beginning of a directory
listing, right near other important files such as
<i>README</i>.) The first name checked, <i>GNUmakefile</i>,
is not recommended for most makefiles. You should use this
name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU
<b>make</b>, and will not be understood by other versions of
<b>make</b>. If <i>makefile</i> is &rsquo;-&rsquo;, the
standard input is read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>make</b>
updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that
have been modified since the target was last modified, or if
the target does not exist.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-b</b>,
<b>-m</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">These options are ignored for
compatibility with other versions of <b>make</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-B</b>,
<b>--always-make</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Unconditionally make all
targets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-C</b> <i>dir</i>,
<b>--directory</b>=<i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Change to directory <i>dir</i>
before reading the makefiles or doing anything else. If
multiple <b>-C</b> options are specified, each is
interpreted relative to the previous one: <b>-C</b> /
<b>-C</b> etc is equivalent to <b>-C</b> /etc. This is
typically used with recursive invocations of
<b>make</b>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-d</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Print debugging information in addition to normal
processing. The debugging information says which files are
being considered for remaking, which file-times are being
compared and with what results, which files actually need to
be remade, which implicit rules are considered and which are
applied---everything interesting about how <b>make</b>
decides what to do.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--debug</b><i>[=FLAGS]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print debugging information in
addition to normal processing. If the <i>FLAGS</i> are
omitted, then the behavior is the same as if <b>-d</b> was
specified. <i>FLAGS</i> may be <i>a</i> for all debugging
output (same as using <b>-d</b>), <i>b</i> for basic
debugging, <i>v</i> for more verbose basic debugging,
<i>i</i> for showing implicit rules, <i>j</i> for details on
invocation of commands, and <i>m</i> for debugging while
remaking makefiles. Use <i>n</i> to disable all previous
debugging flags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-e</b>,
<b>--environment-overrides</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Give variables taken from the
environment precedence over variables from makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-f</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>--file</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--makefile</b>=<i>FILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use <i>file</i> as a
makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-i</b>,
<b>--ignore-errors</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Ignore all errors in commands
executed to remake files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-I</b> <i>dir</i>,
<b>--include-dir</b>=<i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies a directory
<i>dir</i> to search for included makefiles. If several
<b>-I</b> options are used to specify several directories,
the directories are searched in the order specified. Unlike
the arguments to other flags of <b>make</b>, directories
given with <b>-I</b> flags may come directly after the flag:
<b>-I</b><i>dir</i> is allowed, as well as <b>-I</b>
<i>dir</i>. This syntax is allowed for compatibility with
the C preprocessor&rsquo;s <b>-I</b> flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-j</b> [<i>jobs</i>],
<b>--jobs</b>[=<i>jobs</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the number of
<i>jobs</i> (commands) to run simultaneously. If there is
more than one <b>-j</b> option, the last one is effective.
If the <b>-j</b> option is given without an argument,
<b>make</b> will not limit the number of jobs that can run
simultaneously. When <b>make</b> invokes a <b>sub-make,</b>
all instances of make will coordinate to run the specified
number of jobs at a time; see the section <b>PARALLEL MAKE
AND THE JOBSERVER</b> for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--jobserver-fds</b>
[<i>R,W</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Internal option <b>make</b>
uses to pass the jobserver pipe read and write file
descriptor numbers to <b>sub-makes;</b> see the section
<b>PARALLEL MAKE AND THE JOBSERVER</b> for details</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-k</b>,
<b>--keep-going</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Continue as much as possible
after an error. While the target that failed, and those that
depend on it, cannot be remade, the other dependencies of
these targets can be processed all the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-l</b> [<i>load</i>],
<b>--load-average</b>[=<i>load</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies that no new jobs
(commands) should be started if there are others jobs
running and the load average is at least <i>load</i> (a
floating-point number). With no argument, removes a previous
load limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-L</b>,
<b>--check-symlink-times</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use the latest mtime between
symlinks and target.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-n</b>, <b>--just-print</b>,
<b>--dry-run</b>, <b>--recon</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the commands that would
be executed, but do not execute them (except in certain
circumstances).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-o</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>--old-file</b>=<i>file</i>,
<b>--assume-old</b>=<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Do not remake the file
<i>file</i> even if it is older than its dependencies, and
do not remake anything on account of changes in <i>file</i>.
Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules
are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-O</b>[<i>type</i>],
<b>--output-sync</b>[=<i>type</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When running multiple jobs in
parallel with <b>-j</b>, ensure the output of each job is
collected together rather than interspersed with output from
other jobs. If <i>type</i> is not specified or is
<b>target</b> the output from the entire recipe for each
target is grouped together. If <i>type</i> is <b>line</b>
the output from each command line within a recipe is grouped
together. If <i>type</i> is <b>recurse</b> output from an
entire recursive make is grouped together. If <i>type</i> is
<b>none</b> output synchronization is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-p</b>,
<b>--print-data-base</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the data base (rules and
variable values) that results from reading the makefiles;
then execute as usual or as otherwise specified. This also
prints the version information given by the <b>-v</b> switch
(see below). To print the data base without trying to remake
any files, use <i>make -p -f/dev/null</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-q</b>,
<b>--question</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">&rsquo;&rsquo;Question
mode&rsquo;&rsquo;. Do not run any commands, or print
anything; just return an exit status that is zero if the
specified targets are already up to date, nonzero
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-r</b>,
<b>--no-builtin-rules</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Eliminate use of the built-in
implicit rules. Also clear out the default list of suffixes
for suffix rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-R</b>,
<b>--no-builtin-variables</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Don&rsquo;t define any built-in
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>,
<b>--quiet</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Silent operation; do not print
the commands as they are executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-S</b>,
<b>--no-keep-going</b>, <b>--stop</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Cancel the effect of the
<b>-k</b> option. This is never necessary except in a
recursive <b>make</b> where <b>-k</b> might be inherited
from the top-level <b>make</b> via MAKEFLAGS or if you set
<b>-k</b> in MAKEFLAGS in your environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t</b>, <b>--touch</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Touch files (mark them up to
date without really changing them) instead of running their
commands. This is used to pretend that the commands were
done, in order to fool future invocations of
<b>make</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--trace</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Information about the
disposition of each target is printed (why the target is
being rebuilt and what commands are run to rebuild it).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the version of the
<b>make</b> program plus a copyright, a list of authors and
a notice that there is no warranty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-w</b>,
<b>--print-directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print a message containing the
working directory before and after other processing. This
may be useful for tracking down errors from complicated
nests of recursive <b>make</b> commands.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-print-directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Turn off <b>-w</b>, even if it
was turned on implicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-W</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>--what-if</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--new-file</b>=<i>file</i>,
<b>--assume-new</b>=<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Pretend that the target
<i>file</i> has just been modified. When used with the
<b>-n</b> flag, this shows you what would happen if you were
to modify that file. Without <b>-n</b>, it is almost the
same as running a <i>touch</i> command on the given file
before running <b>make</b>, except that the modification
time is changed only in the imagination of <b>make</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--warn-undefined-variables</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Warn when an undefined variable
is referenced.</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GNU <b>make</b>
exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were
successfully parsed and no targets that were built failed. A
status of one will be returned if the <b>-q</b> flag was
used and <b>make</b> determines that a target needs to be
rebuilt. A status of two will be returned if any errors were
encountered.</p>

<h2>SEE ALSO
<a name="SEE ALSO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The full
documentation for <b>make</b> is maintained as a Texinfo
manual. If the <b>info</b> and <b>make</b> programs are
properly installed at your site, the command</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>info
make</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">should give you
access to the complete manual. Additionally, the manual is
also available online at
<i>https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html</i></p>

<h2>PARALLEL MAKE AND THE JOBSERVER
<a name="PARALLEL MAKE AND THE JOBSERVER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using the
<i>-j</i> option, the user can instruct <b>make</b> to
execute tasks in parallel. By specifying a numeric argument
to <i>-j</i> the user may specify an upper limit of the
number of parallel tasks to be run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the build
environment is such that a top level <b>make</b> invokes
<b>sub-makes</b> (for instance, a style in which each
sub-directory contains its own <i>Makefile</i> ), no
individual instance of <b>make</b> knows how many tasks are
running in parallel, so keeping the number of tasks under
the upper limit would be impossible without communication
between all the <b>make</b> instances running. While
solutions like having the top level <b>make</b> serve as a
central controller are feasible, or using other
synchronization mechanisms like shared memory or sockets can
be created, the current implementation uses a simple shared
pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This pipe is
created by the top-level <b>make</b> process, and passed on
to all the <b>sub-makes.</b> The top level
<b>make</b>process<b>writes N-1</b> one-byte tokens into the
pipe (The top level <b>make</b> is assumed to reserve one
token for itself). Whenever any of the <b>make</b> processes
(including the top-level <b>make</b> ) needs to run a new
task, it reads a byte from the shared pipe. If there are no
tokens left, it must wait for a token to be written back to
the pipe. Once the task is completed, the <b>make</b>
process writes a token back to the pipe (and thus, if the
tokens had been exhausted, unblocking the first <b>make</b>
process that was waiting to read a token). Since only
<b>N-1</b> tokens were written into the pipe, no more than
<b>N</b> tasks can be running at any given time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the job to
be run is not a <b>sub-make</b> then <b>make</b> will close
the jobserver pipe file descriptors before invoking the
commands, so that the command can not interfere with the
<i>jobserver,</i> and the command does not find any unusual
file descriptors.</p>
