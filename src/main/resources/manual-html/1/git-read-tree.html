<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-read-tree -
Reads tree information into the index</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
read-tree</i> [[-m [--trivial] [--aggressive] | --reset |
--prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;] <br>
[-u | -i]] [--index-output=&lt;file&gt;]
[--no-sparse-checkout] <br>
(--empty | &lt;tree-ish1&gt; [&lt;tree-ish2&gt;
[&lt;tree-ish3&gt;]])</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reads the tree
information given by &lt;tree-ish&gt; into the index, but
does not actually <b>update</b> any of the files it
&quot;caches&quot;. (see: <a href="https://man.page/1/git-checkout-index">git-checkout-index(1)</a>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Optionally, it
can merge a tree into the index, perform a fast-forward
(i.e. 2-way) merge, or a 3-way merge, with the <b>-m</b>
flag. When used with <b>-m</b>, the <b>-u</b> flag causes it
to also update the files in the work tree with the result of
the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Trivial merges
are done by <i>git read-tree</i> itself. Only conflicting
paths will be in unmerged state when <i>git read-tree</i>
returns.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-m</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perform a merge, not just a
read. The command will refuse to run if your index file has
unmerged entries, indicating that you have not finished
previous merge you started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--reset</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as -m, except that
unmerged entries are discarded instead of failing. When used
with <b>-u</b>, updates leading to loss of working tree
changes or untracked files or directories will not abort the
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-u</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">After a successful merge,
update the files in the work tree with the result of the
merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-i</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually a merge requires the
index file as well as the files in the working tree to be up
to date with the current head commit, in order not to lose
local changes. This flag disables the check with the working
tree and is meant to be used when creating a merge of trees
that are not directly related to the current working tree
status into a temporary index file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-n,
--dry-run</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Check if the command would
error out, without updating the index or the files in the
working tree for real.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-v</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show the progress of checking
files out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--trivial</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Restrict three-way merge by
<i>git read-tree</i> to happen only if there is no
file-level merging required, instead of resolving merge for
trivial cases and leaving conflicting files unresolved in
the index.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--aggressive</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually a three-way merge by
<i>git read-tree</i> resolves the merge for really trivial
cases and leaves other cases unresolved in the index, so
that porcelains can implement different merge policies. This
flag makes the command resolve a few more cases
internally:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; when one
side removes a path and the other side leaves the path
unmodified. The resolution is to remove that path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; when
both sides remove a path. The resolution is to remove that
path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; when
both sides add a path identically. The resolution is to add
that path.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Keep the current index
contents, and read the contents of the named tree-ish under
the directory at <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>. The command will
refuse to overwrite entries that already existed in the
original index file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--index-output=&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of writing the results
out to <b>$GIT_INDEX_FILE</b>, write the resulting index in
the named file. While the command is operating, the original
index file is locked with the same mechanism as usual. The
file must allow to be rename(2)ed into from a temporary file
that is created next to the usual index file; typically this
means it needs to be on the same filesystem as the index
file itself, and you need write permission to the
directories the index file and index output file are located
in.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]recurse-submodules</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Using --recurse-submodules will
update the content of all active submodules according to the
commit recorded in the superproject by calling read-tree
recursively, also setting the submodules' HEAD to be
detached at that commit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--no-sparse-checkout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disable sparse checkout support
even if <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> is true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--empty</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of reading tree
object(s) into the index, just empty it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Quiet, suppress feedback
messages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;tree-ish#&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The id of the tree object(s) to
be read/merged.</p>

<h2>MERGING
<a name="MERGING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>-m</b> is
specified, <i>git read-tree</i> can perform 3 kinds of
merge, a single tree merge if only 1 tree is given, a
fast-forward merge with 2 trees, or a 3-way merge if 3 or
more trees are provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Single Tree
Merge</b> <br>
If only 1 tree is specified, <i>git read-tree</i> operates
as if the user did not specify <b>-m</b>, except that if the
original index has an entry for a given pathname, and the
contents of the path match with the tree being read, the
stat info from the index is used. (In other words, the
index&rsquo;s stat()s take precedence over the merged
tree&rsquo;s).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That means that
if you do a <b>git read-tree -m &lt;newtree&gt;</b> followed
by a <b>git checkout-index -f -u -a</b>, the <i>git
checkout-index</i> only checks out the stuff that really
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is used to
avoid unnecessary false hits when <i>git diff-files</i> is
run after <i>git read-tree</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Two Tree
Merge</b> <br>
Typically, this is invoked as <b>git read-tree -m $H $M</b>,
where $H is the head commit of the current repository, and
$M is the head of a foreign tree, which is simply ahead of
$H (i.e. we are in a fast-forward situation).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When two trees
are specified, the user is telling <i>git read-tree</i> the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. The current
index and work tree is derived from $H, but the user may
have local changes in them since $H.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. The user
wants to fast-forward to $M.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case,
the <b>git read-tree -m $H $M</b> command makes sure that no
local change is lost as the result of this
&quot;merge&quot;. Here are the &quot;carry forward&quot;
rules, where &quot;I&quot; denotes the index,
&quot;clean&quot; means that index and work tree coincide,
and &quot;exists&quot;/&quot;nothing&quot; refer to the
presence of a path in the specified commit:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I H M Result
<br>
------------------------------------------------------- <br>
0 nothing nothing nothing (does not happen) <br>
1 nothing nothing exists use M <br>
2 nothing exists nothing remove path from index <br>
3 nothing exists exists, use M if &quot;initial
checkout&quot;, <br>
H == M keep index otherwise <br>
exists, fail <br>
H != M</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">clean I==H I==M
<br>
------------------ <br>
4 yes N/A N/A nothing nothing keep index <br>
5 no N/A N/A nothing nothing keep index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">6 yes N/A yes
nothing exists keep index <br>
7 no N/A yes nothing exists keep index <br>
8 yes N/A no nothing exists fail <br>
9 no N/A no nothing exists fail</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">10 yes yes N/A
exists nothing remove path from index <br>
11 no yes N/A exists nothing fail <br>
12 yes no N/A exists nothing fail <br>
13 no no N/A exists nothing fail</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">clean (H==M)
<br>
------ <br>
14 yes exists exists keep index <br>
15 no exists exists keep index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">clean I==H I==M
(H!=M) <br>
------------------ <br>
16 yes no no exists exists fail <br>
17 no no no exists exists fail <br>
18 yes no yes exists exists keep index <br>
19 no no yes exists exists keep index <br>
20 yes yes no exists exists use M <br>
21 no yes no exists exists fail</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In all
&quot;keep index&quot; cases, the index entry stays as in
the original index file. If the entry is not up to date,
<i>git read-tree</i> keeps the copy in the work tree intact
when operating under the -u flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When this form
of <i>git read-tree</i> returns successfully, you can see
which of the &quot;local changes&quot; that you made were
carried forward by running <b>git diff-index --cached
$M</b>. Note that this does not necessarily match what
<b>git diff-index --cached $H</b> would have produced before
such a two tree merge. This is because of cases 18 and 19
--- if you already had the changes in $M (e.g. maybe you
picked it up via e-mail in a patch form), <b>git diff-index
--cached $H</b> would have told you about the change before
this merge, but it would not show in <b>git diff-index
--cached $M</b> output after the two-tree merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Case 3 is
slightly tricky and needs explanation. The result from this
rule logically should be to remove the path if the user
staged the removal of the path and then switching to a new
branch. That however will prevent the initial checkout from
happening, so the rule is modified to use M (new tree) only
when the content of the index is empty. Otherwise the
removal of the path is kept as long as $H and $M are the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>3-Way
Merge</b> <br>
Each &quot;index&quot; entry has two bits worth of
&quot;stage&quot; state. stage 0 is the normal one, and is
the only one you&rsquo;d see in any kind of normal use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, when
you do <i>git read-tree</i> with three trees, the
&quot;stage&quot; starts out at 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
you can do</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git read-tree
-m &lt;tree1&gt; &lt;tree2&gt; &lt;tree3&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and you will
end up with an index with all of the &lt;tree1&gt; entries
in &quot;stage1&quot;, all of the &lt;tree2&gt; entries in
&quot;stage2&quot; and all of the &lt;tree3&gt; entries in
&quot;stage3&quot;. When performing a merge of another
branch into the current branch, we use the common ancestor
tree as &lt;tree1&gt;, the current branch head as
&lt;tree2&gt;, and the other branch head as
&lt;tree3&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore,
<i>git read-tree</i> has special-case logic that says: if
you see a file that matches in all respects in the following
states, it &quot;collapses&quot; back to
&quot;stage0&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; stage 2
and 3 are the same; take one or the other (it makes no
difference - the same work has been done on our branch in
stage 2 and their branch in stage 3)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; stage 1
and stage 2 are the same and stage 3 is different; take
stage 3 (our branch in stage 2 did not do anything since the
ancestor in stage 1 while their branch in stage 3 worked on
it)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; stage 1
and stage 3 are the same and stage 2 is different take stage
2 (we did something while they did nothing)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>git
write-tree</i> command refuses to write a nonsensical tree,
and it will complain about unmerged entries if it sees a
single entry that is not stage 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OK, this all
sounds like a collection of totally nonsensical rules, but
it&rsquo;s actually exactly what you want in order to do a
fast merge. The different stages represent the &quot;result
tree&quot; (stage 0, aka &quot;merged&quot;), the original
tree (stage 1, aka &quot;orig&quot;), and the two trees you
are trying to merge (stage 2 and 3 respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The order of
stages 1, 2 and 3 (hence the order of three &lt;tree-ish&gt;
command-line arguments) are significant when you start a
3-way merge with an index file that is already populated.
Here is an outline of how the algorithm works:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; if a
file exists in identical format in all three trees, it will
automatically collapse to &quot;merged&quot; state by <i>git
read-tree</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; a file
that has <i>any</i> difference what-so-ever in the three
trees will stay as separate entries in the index. It&rsquo;s
up to &quot;porcelain policy&quot; to determine how to
remove the non-0 stages, and insert a merged version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; the
index file saves and restores with all this information, so
you can merge things incrementally, but as long as it has
entries in stages 1/2/3 (i.e., &quot;unmerged entries&quot;)
you can&rsquo;t write the result. So now the merge algorithm
ends up being really simple:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; you walk
the index in order, and ignore all entries of stage 0, since
they&rsquo;ve already been done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; if you
find a &quot;stage1&quot;, but no matching
&quot;stage2&quot; or &quot;stage3&quot;, you know
it&rsquo;s been removed from both trees (it only existed in
the original tree), and you remove that entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; if you
find a matching &quot;stage2&quot; and &quot;stage3&quot;
tree, you remove one of them, and turn the other into a
&quot;stage0&quot; entry. Remove any matching
&quot;stage1&quot; entry if it exists too. .. all the normal
trivial rules ..</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You would
normally use <i>git merge-index</i> with supplied <i>git
merge-one-file</i> to do this last step. The script updates
the files in the working tree as it merges each path and at
the end of a successful merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you start
a 3-way merge with an index file that is already populated,
it is assumed that it represents the state of the files in
your work tree, and you can even have files with changes
unrecorded in the index file. It is further assumed that
this state is &quot;derived&quot; from the stage 2 tree. The
3-way merge refuses to run if it finds an entry in the
original index file that does not match stage 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is done to
prevent you from losing your work-in-progress changes, and
mixing your random changes in an unrelated merge commit. To
illustrate, suppose you start from what has been committed
last to your repository:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ JC=&rsquo;git
rev-parse --verify &quot;HEAD^0&quot;&rsquo; <br>
$ git checkout-index -f -u -a $JC</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You do random
edits, without running <i>git update-index</i>. And then you
notice that the tip of your &quot;upstream&quot; tree has
advanced since you pulled from him:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git fetch
git://.... linus <br>
$ LT=&rsquo;git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your work tree
is still based on your HEAD ($JC), but you have some edits
since. Three-way merge makes sure that you have not added or
modified index entries since $JC, and if you haven&rsquo;t,
then does the right thing. So with the following
sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git read-tree
-m -u &rsquo;git merge-base $JC $LT&rsquo; $JC $LT <br>
$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file -a <br>
$ echo &quot;Merge with Linus&quot; | \ <br>
git commit-tree &rsquo;git write-tree&rsquo; -p $JC -p
$LT</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">what you would
commit is a pure merge between $JC and $LT without your
work-in-progress changes, and your work tree would be
updated to the result of the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, if you
have local changes in the working tree that would be
overwritten by this merge, <i>git read-tree</i> will refuse
to run to prevent your changes from being lost.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
there is no need to worry about what exists only in the
working tree. When you have local changes in a part of the
project that is not involved in the merge, your changes do
not interfere with the merge, and are kept intact. When they
<b>do</b> interfere, the merge does not even start (<i>git
read-tree</i> complains loudly and fails without modifying
anything). In such a case, you can simply continue doing
what you were in the middle of doing, and when your working
tree is ready (i.e. you have finished your
work-in-progress), attempt the merge again.</p>

<h2>SPARSE CHECKOUT
<a name="SPARSE CHECKOUT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Sparse
checkout&quot; allows populating the working directory
sparsely. It uses the skip-worktree bit (see
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-update-index">git-update-index(1)</a>) to tell Git whether a file in
the working directory is worth looking at.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
read-tree</i> and other merge-based commands (<i>git
merge</i>, <i>git checkout</i>...) can help maintaining the
skip-worktree bitmap and working directory update.
<b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> is used to define the
skip-worktree reference bitmap. When <i>git read-tree</i>
needs to update the working directory, it resets the
skip-worktree bit in the index based on this file, which
uses the same syntax as .gitignore files. If an entry
matches a pattern in this file, skip-worktree will not be
set on that entry. Otherwise, skip-worktree will be set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then it
compares the new skip-worktree value with the previous one.
If skip-worktree turns from set to unset, it will add the
corresponding file back. If it turns from unset to set, that
file will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While
<b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> is usually used to
specify what files are in, you can also specify what files
are <i>not</i> in, using negate patterns. For example, to
remove the file <b>unwanted</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">/* <br>
!unwanted</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another tricky
thing is fully repopulating the working directory when you
no longer want sparse checkout. You cannot just disable
&quot;sparse checkout&quot; because skip-worktree bits are
still in the index and your working directory is still
sparsely populated. You should re-populate the working
directory with the <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> file
content as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">/*</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then you can
disable sparse checkout. Sparse checkout support in <i>git
read-tree</i> and similar commands is disabled by default.
You need to turn <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> on in order to
have sparse checkout support.</p>
