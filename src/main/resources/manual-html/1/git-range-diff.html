<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
shows the differences between two versions of a patch
series, or more generally, two commit ranges (ignoring merge
commits).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To that end, it
first finds pairs of commits from both commit ranges that
correspond with each other. Two commits are said to
correspond when the diff between their patches (i.e. the
author information, the commit message and the commit diff)
is reasonably small compared to the patches' size. See
&rsquo;&rsquo;Algorithm&rsquo;&rsquo; below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, the
list of matching commits is shown in the order of the second
commit range, with unmatched commits being inserted just
after all of their ancestors have been shown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
ways to specify the commit ranges:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>&lt;range1&gt; &lt;range2&gt;</b>: Either commit range
can be of the form <b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;</b>,
<b>&lt;rev&gt;^!</b> or <b>&lt;rev&gt;^-&lt;n&gt;</b>. See
<b>SPECIFYING RANGES</b> in <a href="https://man.page/7/gitrevisions">gitrevisions(7)</a> for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>&lt;rev1&gt;...&lt;rev2&gt;</b>. This is equivalent to
<b>&lt;rev2&gt;..&lt;rev1&gt;
&lt;rev1&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>&lt;base&gt; &lt;rev1&gt; &lt;rev2&gt;</b>: This is
equivalent to <b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev1&gt;
&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;</b>.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--no-dual-color</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When the commit diffs differ,
&rsquo;git range-diff&rsquo; recreates the original
diffs&rsquo; coloring, and adds outer -/+ diff markers with
the <b>background</b> being red/green to make it easier to
see e.g. when there was a change in what exact lines were
added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
the commit diff lines that are only present in the first
commit range are shown &quot;dimmed&quot; (this can be
overridden using the <b>color.diff.&lt;slot&gt;</b> config
setting where <b>&lt;slot&gt;</b> is one of
<b>contextDimmed</b>, <b>oldDimmed</b> and
<b>newDimmed</b>), and the commit diff lines that are only
present in the second commit range are shown in bold (which
can be overridden using the config settings
<b>color.diff.&lt;slot&gt;</b> with <b>&lt;slot&gt;</b>
being one of <b>contextBold</b>, <b>oldBold</b> or
<b>newBold</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is known
to <b>range-diff</b> as &quot;dual coloring&quot;. Use
<b>--no-dual-color</b> to revert to color all lines
according to the outer diff markers (and completely ignore
the inner diff when it comes to color).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--creation-factor=&lt;percent&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the creation/deletion cost
fudge factor to <b>&lt;percent&gt;</b>. Defaults to 60. Try
a larger value if <b>git range-diff</b> erroneously
considers a large change a total rewrite (deletion of one
commit and addition of another), and a smaller one in the
reverse case. See the &rsquo;&rsquo;Algorithm&rsquo;&rsquo;
section below for an explanation why this is needed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--left-only</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suppress commits that are
missing from the first specified range (or the &quot;left
range&quot; when using the
<b>&lt;rev1&gt;...&lt;rev2&gt;</b> format).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--right-only</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suppress commits that are
missing from the second specified range (or the &quot;right
range&quot; when using the
<b>&lt;rev1&gt;...&lt;rev2&gt;</b> format).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">--[no-]notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag is passed to the
<b>git log</b> program (see <a href="https://man.page/1/git-log">git-log(1)</a>) that
generates the patches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;range1&gt;
&lt;range2&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Compare the commits specified
by the two ranges, where <b>&lt;range1&gt;</b> is considered
an older version of <b>&lt;range2&gt;</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;rev1&gt;...&lt;rev2&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Equivalent to passing
<b>&lt;rev2&gt;..&lt;rev1&gt;</b> and
<b>&lt;rev1&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;base&gt;
&lt;rev1&gt; &lt;rev2&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Equivalent to passing
<b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev1&gt;</b> and
<b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;</b>. Note that
<b>&lt;base&gt;</b> does not need to be the exact branch
point of the branches. Example: after rebasing a branch
<b>my-topic</b>, <b>git range-diff my-topic@{u} my-topic@{1}
my-topic</b> would show the differences introduced by the
rebase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git
range-diff</b> also accepts the regular diff options (see
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-diff">git-diff(1)</a>), most notably the
<b>--color=[&lt;when&gt;]</b> and <b>--no-color</b> options.
These options are used when generating the &quot;diff
between patches&quot;, i.e. to compare the author, commit
message and diff of corresponding old/new commits. There is
currently no means to tweak most of the diff options passed
to <b>git log</b> when generating those patches.</p>

<h2>OUTPUT STABILITY
<a name="OUTPUT STABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output of
the <b>range-diff</b> command is subject to change. It is
intended to be human-readable porcelain output, not
something that can be used across versions of Git to get a
textually stable <b>range-diff</b> (as opposed to something
like the <b>--stable</b> option to <a href="https://man.page/1/git-patch-id">git-patch-id(1)</a>).
There&rsquo;s also no equivalent of <a href="https://man.page/1/git-apply">git-apply(1)</a> for
<b>range-diff</b>, the output is not intended to be
machine-readable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is
particularly true when passing in diff options. Currently
some options like <b>--stat</b> can, as an emergent effect,
produce output that&rsquo;s quite useless in the context of
<b>range-diff</b>. Future versions of <b>range-diff</b> may
learn to interpret such options in a manner specific to
<b>range-diff</b> (e.g. for <b>--stat</b> producing
human-readable output which summarizes how the diffstat
changed).</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
uses the <b>diff.color.*</b> and <b>pager.range-diff</b>
settings (the latter is on by default). See
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-config">git-config(1)</a>.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a rebase
required merge conflicts to be resolved, compare the changes
introduced by the rebase directly afterwards using:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
range-diff @{u} @{1} @</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A typical
output of <b>git range-diff</b> would look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this
example, there are 3 old and 3 new commits, where the
developer removed the 3rd, added a new one before the first
two, and modified the commit message of the 2nd commit as
well its diff.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the output
goes to a terminal, it is color-coded by default, just like
regular <b>git diff</b>'s output. In addition, the first
line (adding a commit) is green, the last line (deleting a
commit) is red, the second line (with a perfect match) is
yellow like the commit header of <b>git show</b>'s output,
and the third line colors the old commit red, the new one
green and the rest like <b>git show</b>'s commit header.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A naive
color-coded diff of diffs is actually a bit hard to read,
though, as it colors the entire lines red or green. The line
that added &quot;What is unexpected&quot; in the old commit,
for example, is completely red, even if the intent of the
old commit was to add something.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To help with
that, <b>range</b> uses the <b>--dual-color</b> mode by
default. In this mode, the diff of diffs will retain the
original diff colors, and prefix the lines with -/+ markers
that have their <b>background</b> red or green, to make it
more obvious that they describe how the diff itself
changed.</p>

<h2>ALGORITHM
<a name="ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The general
idea is this: we generate a cost matrix between the commits
in both commit ranges, then solve the least-cost
assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The cost matrix
is populated thusly: for each pair of commits, both diffs
are generated and the &quot;diff of diffs&quot; is
generated, with 3 context lines, then the number of lines in
that diff is used as cost.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid false
positives (e.g. when a patch has been removed, and an
unrelated patch has been added between two iterations of the
same patch series), the cost matrix is extended to allow for
that, by adding fixed-cost entries for wholesale
deletes/adds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example: Let
commits <b>1--2</b> be the first iteration of a patch series
and <b>A--C</b> the second iteration. Let&rsquo;s assume
that <b>A</b> is a cherry-pick of <b>2,</b> and <b>C</b> is
a cherry-pick of <b>1</b> but with a small modification
(say, a fixed typo). Visualize the commits as a bipartite
graph:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1 A</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2 B</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">C</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We are looking
for a &quot;best&quot; explanation of the new series in
terms of the old one. We can represent an
&quot;explanation&quot; as an edge in the graph:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1 A <br>
/ <br>
2 --------' B</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">C</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
explanation comes for &quot;free&quot; because there was no
change. Similarly <b>C</b> could be explained using
<b>1</b>, but that comes at some cost c&gt;0 because of the
modification:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1 ----. A <br>
| / <br>
2 ----+---' B <br>
| <br>
&rsquo;----- C <br>
c&gt;0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In mathematical
terms, what we are looking for is some sort of a minimum
cost bipartite matching; &rsquo;1&rsquo; is matched to
<b>C</b> at some cost, etc. The underlying graph is in fact
a complete bipartite graph; the cost we associate with every
edge is the size of the diff between the two commits&rsquo;
patches. To explain also new commits, we introduce dummy
nodes on both sides:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1 ----. A <br>
| / <br>
2 ----+---' B <br>
| <br>
o &rsquo;----- C <br>
c&gt;0 <br>
o o</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">o o</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The cost of an
edge <b>o--C</b> is the size of <b>C</b>'s diff, modified by
a fudge factor that should be smaller than 100%. The cost of
an edge <b>o--o</b> is free. The fudge factor is necessary
because even if <b>1</b> and <b>C</b> have nothing in
common, they may still share a few empty lines and such,
possibly making the assignment <b>1--C</b>, <b>o--o</b>
slightly cheaper than <b>1--o</b>, <b>o--C</b> even if
<b>1</b> and <b>C</b> have nothing in common. With the fudge
factor we require a much larger common part to consider
patches as corresponding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The overall
time needed to compute this algorithm is the time needed to
compute n+m commit diffs and then n*m diffs of patches, plus
the time needed to compute the least-cost assignment between
n and m diffs. Git uses an implementation of the
Jonker-Volgenant algorithm to solve the assignment problem,
which has cubic runtime complexity. The matching found in
this case will look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1 ----. A <br>
| / <br>
2 ----+---' B <br>
.--+-----' <br>
o -' &rsquo;----- C <br>
c&gt;0 <br>
o ---------- o</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">o ----------
o</p>
