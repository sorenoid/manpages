<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Generators are
small executables placed in /lib/systemd/system-generators/
and other directories listed above. <a href="https://man.page/1/systemd">systemd(1)</a> will
execute these binaries very early at bootup and at
configuration reload time &mdash; before unit files are
loaded. Their main purpose is to convert configuration that
is not native to the service manager into dynamically
generated unit files, symlinks or unit file drop-ins, so
that they can extend the unit file hierarchy the service
manager subsequently loads and operates on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each generator
is called with three directory paths that are to be used for
generator output. In these three directories, generators may
dynamically generate unit files (regular ones, instances, as
well as templates), unit file .d/ drop-ins, and create
symbolic links to unit files to add additional dependencies,
create aliases, or instantiate existing templates. Those
directories are included in the unit load path of
<a href="https://man.page/1/systemd">systemd(1)</a>, allowing generated configuration to
extend or override existing definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Directory paths
for generator output differ by priority: .../generator.early
has priority higher than the admin configuration in /etc/,
while .../generator has lower priority than /etc/ but higher
than vendor configuration in /usr/, and .../generator.late
has priority lower than all other configuration. See the
next section and the discussion of unit load paths and unit
overriding in <b>systemd.unit</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Generators are
loaded from a set of paths determined during compilation, as
listed above. System and user generators are loaded from
directories with names ending in system-generators/ and
user-generators/, respectively. Generators found in
directories listed earlier override the ones with the same
name in directories lower in the list. A symlink to
/dev/null or an empty file can be used to mask a generator,
thereby preventing it from running. Please note that the
order of the two directories with the highest priority is
reversed with respect to the unit load path, and generators
in /run/ overwrite those in /etc/.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After
installing new generators or updating the configuration,
<b>systemctl daemon-reload</b> may be executed. This will
delete the previous configuration created by generators,
re-run all generators, and cause <b>systemd</b> to reload
units from disk. See <a href="https://man.page/1/systemctl">systemctl(1)</a> for more
information.</p>

<h2>OUTPUT DIRECTORIES
<a name="OUTPUT DIRECTORIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Generators are
invoked with three arguments: paths to directories where
generators can place their generated unit files or symlinks.
By default those paths are runtime directories that are
included in the search path of <b>systemd</b>, but a
generator may be called with different paths for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1.
<i>normal-dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In normal use
this is /run/systemd/generator in case of the system
generators and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/generator in case of the
user generators. Unit files placed in this directory take
precedence over vendor unit configuration but not over
native user/administrator unit configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2.
<i>early-dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In normal use
this is /run/systemd/generator.early in case of the system
generators and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/generator.early in case of
the user generators. Unit files placed in this directory
override unit files in /usr/, /run/ and /etc/. This means
that unit files placed in this directory take precedence
over all normal configuration, both vendor and
user/administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3.
<i>late-dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In normal use
this is /run/systemd/generator.late in case of the system
generators and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/generator.late in case of
the user generators. This directory may be used to extend
the unit file tree without overriding any other unit files.
Any native configuration files supplied by the vendor or
user/administrator take precedence.</p>

<h2>NOTES ABOUT WRITING GENERATORS
<a name="NOTES ABOUT WRITING GENERATORS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; All
generators are executed in parallel. That means all
executables are started at the very same time and need to be
able to cope with this parallelism.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Generators are run very early at boot and cannot rely on any
external services. They may not talk to any other process.
That includes simple things such as logging to
<a href="https://man.page/3/syslog">syslog(3)</a>, or <b>systemd</b> itself (this means: no
<a href="https://man.page/1/systemctl">systemctl(1)</a>)! Non-essential file systems like /var/
and /home/ are mounted after generators have run. Generators
can however rely on the most basic kernel functionality to
be available, as well as mounted /sys/, /proc/, /dev/, /usr/
and /run/ file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Units
written by generators are removed when the configuration is
reloaded. That means the lifetime of the generated units is
closely bound to the reload cycles of <b>systemd</b>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Generators should only be used to generate unit files,
.d/*.conf drop-ins for them and symlinks to them, not any
other kind of non-unit related configuration. Due to the
lifecycle logic mentioned above, generators are not a good
fit to generate dynamic configuration for other services. If
you need to generate dynamic configuration for other
services, do so in normal services you order before the
service in question.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that using
the <i>StandardInputData=</i>/<i>StandardInputText=</i>
settings of service unit files (see <b>systemd.exec</b>(5)),
it is possible to make arbitrary input data (including
daemon-specific configuration) part of the unit definitions,
which often might be sufficient to embed data or
configuration for other programs into unit files in a native
fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Since
<a href="https://man.page/3/syslog">syslog(3)</a> is not available (see above), log messages
have to be written to /dev/kmsg instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
generator should always include its own name in a comment at
the top of the generated file, so that the user can easily
figure out which component created or amended a particular
unit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>SourcePath=</i> directive should be used in generated
files to specify the source configuration file they are
generated from. This makes things more easily understood by
the user and also has the benefit that systemd can warn the
user about configuration files that changed on disk but have
not been read yet by systemd. The <i>SourcePath=</i> value
does not have to be a file in a physical filesystem. For
example, in the common case of the generator looking at the
kernel command line, <b>SourcePath=/proc/cmdline</b> should
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Generators may write out dynamic unit files or just hook
unit files into other units with the usual .wants/ or
.requires/ symlinks. Often, it is nicer to simply
instantiate a template unit file from /usr/ with a generator
instead of writing out entirely dynamic unit files. Of
course, this works only if a single parameter is to be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If you
are careful, you can implement generators in shell scripts.
We do recommend C code however, since generators are
executed synchronously and hence delay the entire boot if
they are slow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Regarding overriding semantics: there are two rules we try
to follow when thinking about the overriding semantics:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">1. User
configuration should override vendor configuration. This
(mostly) means that stuff from /etc/ should override stuff
from /usr/.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">2. Native
configuration should override non-native configuration. This
(mostly) means that stuff you generate should never override
native unit files for the same purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Of these two
rules the first rule is probably the more important one and
breaks the second one sometimes. Hence, when deciding
whether to use argv[1], argv[2], or argv[3], your default
choice should probably be argv[1].</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Instead
of heading off now and writing all kind of generators for
legacy configuration file formats, please think twice! It is
often a better idea to just deprecate old stuff instead of
keeping it artificially alive.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;systemd-fstab-generator</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd-fstab-generator</b>(8)
converts /etc/fstab into native mount units. It uses argv[1]
as location to place the generated unit files in order to
allow the user to override /etc/fstab with their own native
unit files, but also to ensure that /etc/fstab overrides any
vendor default from /usr/.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After editing
/etc/fstab, the user should invoke <b>systemctl
daemon-reload</b>. This will re-run all generators and cause
<b>systemd</b> to reload units from disk. To actually mount
new directories added to fstab, <b>systemctl start</b>
<i>/path/to/mountpoint</i> or <b>systemctl start
local-fs.target</b> may be used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;systemd-system-update-generator</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd-system-update-generator</b>(8)
temporarily redirects default.target to
system-update.target, if a system update is scheduled. Since
this needs to override the default user configuration for
default.target, it uses argv[2]. For details about this
logic, see <b>systemd.offline-updates</b>(7).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Debugging
