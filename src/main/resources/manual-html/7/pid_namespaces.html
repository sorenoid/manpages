- overview of Linux PID namespaces</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For an overview
of namespaces, see <b>namespaces</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PID namespaces
isolate the process ID number space, meaning that processes
in different PID namespaces can have the same PID. PID
namespaces allow containers to provide functionality such as
suspending/resuming the set of processes in the container
and migrating the container to a new host while the
processes inside the container maintain the same PIDs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PIDs in a new
PID namespace start at 1, somewhat like a standalone system,
and calls to <b>fork</b>(2), <b>vfork</b>(2), or
<b>clone</b>(2) will produce processes with PIDs that are
unique within the namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use of PID
namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with the
<b>CONFIG_PID_NS</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
namespace init process</b> <br>
The first process created in a new namespace (i.e., the
process created using <b>clone</b>(2) with the
<b>CLONE_NEWPID</b> flag, or the first child created by a
process after a call to <b>unshare</b>(2) using the
<b>CLONE_NEWPID</b> flag) has the PID 1, and is the
&quot;init&quot; process for the namespace (see
<b>init</b>(1)). This process becomes the parent of any
child processes that are orphaned because a process that
resides in this PID namespace terminated (see below for
further details).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;init&quot; process of a PID namespace terminates, the
kernel terminates all of the processes in the namespace via
a <b>SIGKILL</b> signal. This behavior reflects the fact
that the &quot;init&quot; process is essential for the
correct operation of a PID namespace. In this case, a
subsequent <b>fork</b>(2) into this PID namespace fail with
the error <b>ENOMEM</b>; it is not possible to create a new
process in a PID namespace whose &quot;init&quot; process
has terminated. Such scenarios can occur when, for example,
a process uses an open file descriptor for a
<i>/proc/[pid]/ns/pid</i> file corresponding to a process
that was in a namespace to <b>setns</b>(2) into that
namespace after the &quot;init&quot; process has terminated.
Another possible scenario can occur after a call to
<b>unshare</b>(2): if the first child subsequently created
by a <b>fork</b>(2) terminates, then subsequent calls to
<b>fork</b>(2) fail with <b>ENOMEM</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only signals
for which the &quot;init&quot; process has established a
signal handler can be sent to the &quot;init&quot; process
by other members of the PID namespace. This restriction
applies even to privileged processes, and prevents other
members of the PID namespace from accidentally killing the
&quot;init&quot; process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Likewise, a
process in an ancestor namespace can&mdash;subject to the
usual permission checks described in
<b>kill</b>(2)&mdash;send signals to the &quot;init&quot;
process of a child PID namespace only if the
&quot;init&quot; process has established a handler for that
signal. (Within the handler, the <i>siginfo_t si_pid</i>
field described in <b>sigaction</b>(2) will be zero.)
<b>SIGKILL</b> or <b>SIGSTOP</b> are treated exceptionally:
these signals are forcibly delivered when sent from an
ancestor PID namespace. Neither of these signals can be
caught by the &quot;init&quot; process, and so will result
in the usual actions associated with those signals
(respectively, terminating and stopping the process).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Starting with
Linux 3.4, the <b>reboot</b>(2) system call causes a signal
to be sent to the namespace &quot;init&quot; process. See
<b>reboot</b>(2) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Nesting PID
namespaces</b> <br>
PID namespaces can be nested: each PID namespace has a
parent, except for the initial (&quot;root&quot;) PID
namespace. The parent of a PID namespace is the PID
namespace of the process that created the namespace using
<b>clone</b>(2) or <b>unshare</b>(2). PID namespaces thus
form a tree, with all namespaces ultimately tracing their
ancestry to the root namespace. Since Linux 3.7, the kernel
limits the maximum nesting depth for PID namespaces to
32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A process is
visible to other processes in its PID namespace, and to the
processes in each direct ancestor PID namespace going back
to the root PID namespace. In this context,
&quot;visible&quot; means that one process can be the target
of operations by another process using system calls that
specify a process ID. Conversely, the processes in a child
PID namespace can&rsquo;t see processes in the parent and
further removed ancestor namespaces. More succinctly: a
process can see (e.g., send signals with <b>kill</b>(2), set
nice values with <b>setpriority</b>(2), etc.) only processes
contained in its own PID namespace and in descendants of
that namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A process has
one process ID in each of the layers of the PID namespace
hierarchy in which is visible, and walking back though each
direct ancestor namespace through to the root PID namespace.
System calls that operate on process IDs always operate
using the process ID that is visible in the PID namespace of
the caller. A call to <b>getpid</b>(2) always returns the
PID associated with the namespace in which the process was
created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some processes
in a PID namespace may have parents that are outside of the
namespace. For example, the parent of the initial process in
the namespace (i.e., the <b>init</b>(1) process with PID 1)
is necessarily in another namespace. Likewise, the direct
children of a process that uses <b>setns</b>(2) to cause its
children to join a PID namespace are in a different PID
namespace from the caller of <b>setns</b>(2). Calls to
<b>getppid</b>(2) for such processes return 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While processes
may freely descend into child PID namespaces (e.g., using
<b>setns</b>(2) with a PID namespace file descriptor), they
may not move in the other direction. That is to say,
processes may not enter any ancestor namespaces (parent,
grandparent, etc.). Changing PID namespaces is a one-way
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>NS_GET_PARENT ioctl</b>(2) operation can be used to
discover the parental relationship between PID namespaces;
see <b>ioctl_ns</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>setns(2) and
unshare(2) semantics</b> <br>
Calls to <b>setns</b>(2) that specify a PID namespace file
descriptor and calls to <b>unshare</b>(2) with the
<b>CLONE_NEWPID</b> flag cause children subsequently created
by the caller to be placed in a different PID namespace from
the caller. (Since Linux 4.12, that PID namespace is shown
via the <i>/proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children</i> file, as
described in <b>namespaces</b>(7).) These calls do not,
however, change the PID namespace of the calling process,
because doing so would change the caller&rsquo;s idea of its
own PID (as reported by <b>getpid</b>()), which would break
many applications and libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To put things
another way: a process&rsquo;s PID namespace membership is
determined when the process is created and cannot be changed
thereafter. Among other things, this means that the parental
relationship between processes mirrors the parental
relationship between PID namespaces: the parent of a process
is either in the same namespace or resides in the immediate
parent PID namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A process may
call <b>unshare</b>(2) with the <b>CLONE_NEWPID</b> flag
only once. After it has performed this operation, its
<i>/proc/PID/ns/pid_for_children</i> symbolic link will be
empty until the first child is created in the namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Adoption of
orphaned children</b> <br>
When a child process becomes orphaned, it is reparented to
the &quot;init&quot; process in the PID namespace of its
parent (unless one of the nearer ancestors of the parent
employed the <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</b>
command to mark itself as the reaper of orphaned descendant
processes). Note that because of the <b>setns</b>(2) and
<b>unshare</b>(2) semantics described above, this may be the
&quot;init&quot; process in the PID namespace that is the
<i>parent</i> of the child&rsquo;s PID namespace, rather
than the &quot;init&quot; process in the child&rsquo;s own
PID namespace.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compatibility
of CLONE_NEWPID with other CLONE_* flags</b> <br>
In current versions of Linux, <b>CLONE_NEWPID</b>
can&rsquo;t be combined with <b>CLONE_THREAD</b>. Threads
are required to be in the same PID namespace such that the
threads in a process can send signals to each other.
Similarly, it must be possible to see all of the threads of
a processes in the <b>proc</b>(5) filesystem. Additionally,
if two threads were in different PID namespaces, the process
ID of the process sending a signal could not be meaningfully
encoded when a signal is sent (see the description of the
<i>siginfo_t</i> type in <b>sigaction</b>(2)). Since this is
computed when a signal is enqueued, a signal queue shared by
processes in multiple PID namespaces would defeat that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In earlier
versions of Linux, <b>CLONE_NEWPID</b> was additionally
disallowed (failing with the error <b>EINVAL</b>) in
combination with <b>CLONE_SIGHAND</b> (before Linux 4.3) as
well as <b>CLONE_VM</b> (before Linux 3.12). The changes
that lifted these restrictions have also been ported to
earlier stable kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/proc and
PID namespaces</b> <br>
A <i>/proc</i> filesystem shows (in the <i>/proc/[pid]</i>
directories) only processes visible in the PID namespace of
the process that performed the mount, even if the
<i>/proc</i> filesystem is viewed from processes in other
namespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After creating
a new PID namespace, it is useful for the child to change
its root directory and mount a new procfs instance at
<i>/proc</i> so that tools such as <b>ps</b>(1) work
correctly. If a new mount namespace is simultaneously
created by including <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> in the <i>flags</i>
argument of <b>clone</b>(2) or <b>unshare</b>(2), then it
isn&rsquo;t necessary to change the root directory: a new
procfs instance can be mounted directly over
<i>/proc</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From a shell,
the command to mount <i>/proc</i> is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ mount -t proc
proc /proc</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Calling
<b>readlink</b>(2) on the path <i>/proc/self</i> yields the
process ID of the caller in the PID namespace of the procfs
mount (i.e., the PID namespace of the process that mounted
the procfs). This can be useful for introspection purposes,
when a process wants to discover its PID in other
namespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/proc files
<br>
/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid</b> (since Linux 3.3)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file (which is virtualized
per PID namespace) displays the last PID that was allocated
in this PID namespace. When the next PID is allocated, the
kernel will search for the lowest unallocated PID that is
greater than this value, and when this file is subsequently
read it will show that PID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This file is
writable by a process that has the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> or
(since Linux 5.9) <b>CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</b> capability
inside the user namespace that owns the PID namespace. This
makes it possible to determine the PID that is allocated to
the next process that is created inside this PID
namespace.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Miscellaneous</b>
<br>
When a process ID is passed over a UNIX domain socket to a
process in a different PID namespace (see the description of
<b>SCM_CREDENTIALS</b> in <b>unix</b>(7)), it is translated
into the corresponding PID value in the receiving
process&rsquo;s PID namespace.</p>
