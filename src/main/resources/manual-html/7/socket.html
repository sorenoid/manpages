<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>sockfd</i>
<b>= socket(int</b> <i>socket_family</i><b>, int</b>
<i>socket_type</i><b>, int</b> <i>protocol</i><b>);</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page describes the Linux networking socket layer user
interface. The BSD compatible sockets are the uniform
interface between the user process and the network protocol
stacks in the kernel. The protocol modules are grouped into
<i>protocol families</i> such as <b>AF_INET</b>,
<b>AF_IPX</b>, and <b>AF_PACKET</b>, and <i>socket types</i>
such as <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> or <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b>. See
<b>socket</b>(2) for more information on families and
types.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Socket-layer
functions</b> <br>
These functions are used by the user process to send or
receive packets and to do other socket operations. For more
information see their respective manual pages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>socket</b>(2)
creates a socket, <b>connect</b>(2) connects a socket to a
remote socket address, the <b>bind</b>(2) function binds a
socket to a local socket address, <b>listen</b>(2) tells the
socket that new connections shall be accepted, and
<b>accept</b>(2) is used to get a new socket with a new
incoming connection. <b>socketpair</b>(2) returns two
connected anonymous sockets (implemented only for a few
local families like <b>AF_UNIX</b>)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>send</b>(2),
<b>sendto</b>(2), and <b>sendmsg</b>(2) send data over a
socket, and <b>recv</b>(2), <b>recvfrom</b>(2),
<b>recvmsg</b>(2) receive data from a socket. <b>poll</b>(2)
and <b>select</b>(2) wait for arriving data or a readiness
to send data. In addition, the standard I/O operations like
<b>write</b>(2), <b>writev</b>(2), <b>sendfile</b>(2),
<b>read</b>(2), and <b>readv</b>(2) can be used to read and
write data.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>getsockname</b>(2)
returns the local socket address and <b>getpeername</b>(2)
returns the remote socket address. <b>getsockopt</b>(2) and
<b>setsockopt</b>(2) are used to set or get socket layer or
protocol options. <b>ioctl</b>(2) can be used to set or read
some other options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>close</b>(2)
is used to close a socket. <b>shutdown</b>(2) closes parts
of a full-duplex socket connection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Seeking, or
calling <b>pread</b>(2) or <b>pwrite</b>(2) with a nonzero
position is not supported on sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to do nonblocking I/O on sockets by setting the
<b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag on a socket file descriptor using
<b>fcntl</b>(2). Then all operations that would block will
(usually) return with <b>EAGAIN</b> (operation should be
retried later); <b>connect</b>(2) will return
<b>EINPROGRESS</b> error. The user can then wait for various
events via <b>poll</b>(2) or <b>select</b>(2).</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-3524441.png" alt="Image grohtml-3524441.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
to <b>poll</b>(2) and <b>select</b>(2) is to let the kernel
inform the application about events via a <b>SIGIO</b>
signal. For that the <b>O_ASYNC</b> flag must be set on a
socket file descriptor via <b>fcntl</b>(2) and a valid
signal handler for <b>SIGIO</b> must be installed via
<b>sigaction</b>(2). See the <i>Signals</i> discussion
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Socket
address structures</b> <br>
Each socket domain has its own format for socket addresses,
with a domain-specific address structure. Each of these
structures begins with an integer &quot;family&quot; field
(typed as <i>sa_family_t</i>) that indicates the type of the
address structure. This allows the various system calls
(e.g., <b>connect</b>(2), <b>bind</b>(2), <b>accept</b>(2),
<b>getsockname</b>(2), <b>getpeername</b>(2)), which are
generic to all socket domains, to determine the domain of a
particular socket address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To allow any
type of socket address to be passed to interfaces in the
sockets API, the type <i>struct sockaddr</i> is defined. The
purpose of this type is purely to allow casting of
domain-specific socket address types to a
&quot;generic&quot; type, so as to avoid compiler warnings
about type mismatches in calls to the sockets API.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
the sockets API provides the data type <i>struct
sockaddr_storage</i>. This type is suitable to accommodate
all supported domain-specific socket address structures; it
is large enough and is aligned properly. (In particular, it
is large enough to hold IPv6 socket addresses.) The
structure includes the following field, which can be used to
identify the type of socket address actually stored in the
structure:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sa_family_t
ss_family;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sockaddr_storage</i> structure is useful in programs that
must handle socket addresses in a generic way (e.g.,
programs that must deal with both IPv4 and IPv6 socket
addresses).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Socket
options</b> <br>
The socket options listed below can be set by using
<b>setsockopt</b>(2) and read with <b>getsockopt</b>(2) with
the socket level set to <b>SOL_SOCKET</b> for all sockets.
Unless otherwise noted, <i>optval</i> is a pointer to an
<i>int</i>. <b><br>
SO_ACCEPTCONN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a value indicating
whether or not this socket has been marked to accept
connections with <b>listen</b>(2). The value 0 indicates
that this is not a listening socket, the value 1 indicates
that this is a listening socket. This socket option is
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER</b> (since
Linux 2.2), <b>SO_ATTACH_BPF</b> (since Linux 3.19)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Attach a classic BPF
(<b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER</b>) or an extended BPF
(<b>SO_ATTACH_BPF</b>) program to the socket for use as a
filter of incoming packets. A packet will be dropped if the
filter program returns zero. If the filter program returns a
nonzero value which is less than the packet&rsquo;s data
length, the packet will be truncated to the length returned.
If the value returned by the filter is greater than or equal
to the packet&rsquo;s data length, the packet is allowed to
proceed unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
for <b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER</b> is a <i>sock_fprog</i>
structure, defined in <i>&lt;linux/filter.h&gt;</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">struct
sock_fprog { <br>
unsigned short len; <br>
struct sock_filter *filter; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
for <b>SO_ATTACH_BPF</b> is a file descriptor returned by
the <b>bpf</b>(2) system call and must refer to a program of
type <b>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">These options
may be set multiple times for a given socket, each time
replacing the previous filter program. The classic and
extended versions may be called on the same socket, but the
previous filter will always be replaced such that a socket
never has more than one filter defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Both classic
and extended BPF are explained in the kernel source file
<i>Documentation/networking/filter.txt</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF</b>,
<b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For use with the
<b>SO_REUSEPORT</b> option, these options allow the user to
set a classic BPF (<b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF</b>) or an
extended BPF (<b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF</b>) program which
defines how packets are assigned to the sockets in the
reuseport group (that is, all sockets which have
<b>SO_REUSEPORT</b> set and are using the same local address
to receive packets).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The BPF program
must return an index between 0 and N-1 representing the
socket which should receive the packet (where N is the
number of sockets in the group). If the BPF program returns
an invalid index, socket selection will fall back to the
plain <b>SO_REUSEPORT</b> mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Sockets are
numbered in the order in which they are added to the group
(that is, the order of <b>bind</b>(2) calls for UDP sockets
or the order of <b>listen</b>(2) calls for TCP sockets). New
sockets added to a reuseport group will inherit the BPF
program. When a socket is removed from a reuseport group
(via <b>close</b>(2)), the last socket in the group will be
moved into the closed socket&rsquo;s position.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">These options
may be set repeatedly at any time on any socket in the group
to replace the current BPF program used by all sockets in
the group.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF</b>
takes the same argument type as <b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER</b> and
<b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF</b> takes the same argument type
as <b>SO_ATTACH_BPF</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">UDP support for
this feature is available since Linux 4.5; TCP support is
available since Linux 4.6.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_BINDTODEVICE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Bind this socket to a
particular device like &ldquo;eth0&rdquo;, as specified in
the passed interface name. If the name is an empty string or
the option length is zero, the socket device binding is
removed. The passed option is a variable-length
null-terminated interface name string with the maximum size
of <b>IFNAMSIZ</b>. If a socket is bound to an interface,
only packets received from that particular interface are
processed by the socket. Note that this works only for some
socket types, particularly <b>AF_INET</b> sockets. It is not
supported for packet sockets (use normal <b>bind</b>(2)
there).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Before Linux
3.8, this socket option could be set, but could not
retrieved with <b>getsockopt</b>(2). Since Linux 3.8, it is
readable. The <i>optlen</i> argument should contain the
buffer size available to receive the device name and is
recommended to be <b>IFNAMSIZ</b> bytes. The real device
name length is reported back in the <i>optlen</i>
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_BROADCAST</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set or get the broadcast flag.
When enabled, datagram sockets are allowed to send packets
to a broadcast address. This option has no effect on
stream-oriented sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_BSDCOMPAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable BSD bug-to-bug
compatibility. This is used by the UDP protocol module in
Linux 2.0 and 2.2. If enabled, ICMP errors received for a
UDP socket will not be passed to the user program. In later
kernel versions, support for this option has been phased
out: Linux 2.4 silently ignores it, and Linux 2.6 generates
a kernel warning (printk()) if a program uses this option.
Linux 2.0 also enabled BSD bug-to-bug compatibility options
(random header changing, skipping of the broadcast flag) for
raw sockets with this option, but that was removed in Linux
2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_DEBUG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable socket debugging.
Allowed only for processes with the <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>
capability or an effective user ID of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_DETACH_FILTER</b> (since
Linux 2.2), <b>SO_DETACH_BPF</b> (since Linux 3.19)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These two options, which are
synonyms, may be used to remove the classic or extended BPF
program attached to a socket with either
<b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER</b> or <b>SO_ATTACH_BPF</b>. The option
value is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_DOMAIN</b> (since Linux
2.6.32)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Retrieves the socket domain as
an integer, returning a value such as <b>AF_INET6</b>. See
<b>socket</b>(2) for details. This socket option is
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_ERROR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Get and clear the pending
socket error. This socket option is read-only. Expects an
integer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_DONTROUTE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t send via a gateway,
send only to directly connected hosts. The same effect can
be achieved by setting the <b>MSG_DONTROUTE</b> flag on a
socket <b>send</b>(2) operation. Expects an integer boolean
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_INCOMING_CPU</b>
(gettable since Linux 3.19, settable since Linux 4.4)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets or gets the CPU affinity
of a socket. Expects an integer flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">int cpu = 1;
<br>
setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_INCOMING_CPU, &amp;cpu, <br>
sizeof(cpu));</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Because all of
the packets for a single stream (i.e., all packets for the
same 4-tuple) arrive on the single RX queue that is
associated with a particular CPU, the typical use case is to
employ one listening process per RX queue, with the incoming
flow being handled by a listener on the same CPU that is
handling the RX queue. This provides optimal NUMA behavior
and keeps CPU caches hot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_INCOMING_NAPI_ID</b>
(gettable since Linux 4.12)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a system-level unique
ID called NAPI ID that is associated with a RX queue on
which the last packet associated with that socket is
received.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
used by an application to split the incoming flows among
worker threads based on the RX queue on which the packets
associated with the flows are received. It allows each
worker thread to be associated with a NIC HW receive queue
and service all the connection requests received on that RX
queue. This mapping between a app thread and a HW NIC queue
streamlines the flow of data from the NIC to the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_KEEPALIVE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable sending of keep-alive
messages on connection-oriented sockets. Expects an integer
boolean flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_LINGER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets or gets the
<b>SO_LINGER</b> option. The argument is a <i>linger</i>
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">struct linger {
<br>
int l_onoff; /* linger active */ <br>
int l_linger; /* how many seconds to linger for */ <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When enabled, a
<b>close</b>(2) or <b>shutdown</b>(2) will not return until
all queued messages for the socket have been successfully
sent or the linger timeout has been reached. Otherwise, the
call returns immediately and the closing is done in the
background. When the socket is closed as part of
<b>exit</b>(2), it always lingers in the background.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_LOCK_FILTER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set, this option will
prevent changing the filters associated with the socket.
These filters include any set using the socket options
<b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER</b>, <b>SO_ATTACH_BPF</b>,
<b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF</b>, and
<b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The typical use
case is for a privileged process to set up a raw socket (an
operation that requires the <b>CAP_NET_RAW</b> capability),
apply a restrictive filter, set the <b>SO_LOCK_FILTER</b>
option, and then either drop its privileges or pass the
socket file descriptor to an unprivileged process via a UNIX
domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Once the
<b>SO_LOCK_FILTER</b> option has been enabled, attempts to
change or remove the filter attached to a socket, or to
disable the <b>SO_LOCK_FILTER</b> option will fail with the
error <b>EPERM</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_MARK</b> (since Linux
2.6.25)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the mark for each packet
sent through this socket (similar to the netfilter MARK
target but socket-based). Changing the mark can be used for
mark-based routing without netfilter or for packet
filtering. Setting this option requires the
<b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b> capability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_OOBINLINE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this option is enabled,
out-of-band data is directly placed into the receive data
stream. Otherwise, out-of-band data is passed only when the
<b>MSG_OOB</b> flag is set during receiving.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PASSCRED</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable the receiving
of the <b>SCM_CREDENTIALS</b> control message. For more
information see <b>unix</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PASSSEC</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable the receiving
of the <b>SCM_SECURITY</b> control message. For more
information see <b>unix</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PEEK_OFF</b> (since Linux
3.4)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option, which is currently
supported only for <b>unix</b>(7) sockets, sets the value of
the &quot;peek offset&quot; for the <b>recv</b>(2) system
call when used with <b>MSG_PEEK</b> flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When this
option is set to a negative value (it is set to -1 for all
new sockets), traditional behavior is provided:
<b>recv</b>(2) with the <b>MSG_PEEK</b> flag will peek data
from the front of the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When the option
is set to a value greater than or equal to zero, then the
next peek at data queued in the socket will occur at the
byte offset specified by the option value. At the same time,
the &quot;peek offset&quot; will be incremented by the
number of bytes that were peeked from the queue, so that a
subsequent peek will return the next data in the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If data is
removed from the front of the queue via a call to
<b>recv</b>(2) (or similar) without the <b>MSG_PEEK</b>
flag, the &quot;peek offset&quot; will be decreased by the
number of bytes removed. In other words, receiving data
without the <b>MSG_PEEK</b> flag will cause the &quot;peek
offset&quot; to be adjusted to maintain the correct relative
position in the queued data, so that a subsequent peek will
retrieve the data that would have been retrieved had the
data not been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For datagram
sockets, if the &quot;peek offset&quot; points to the middle
of a packet, the data returned will be marked with the
<b>MSG_TRUNC</b> flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example serves to illustrate the use of <b>SO_PEEK_OFF</b>.
Suppose a stream socket has the following queued input
data:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">aabbccddeeff</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The following
sequence of <b>recv</b>(2) calls would have the effect noted
in the comments:</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">int ov = 4; //
Set peek offset to 4 <br>
setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEEK_OFF, &amp;ov,
sizeof(ov));</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">recv(fd, buf,
2, MSG_PEEK); // Peeks &quot;cc&quot;; offset set to 6 <br>
recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK); // Peeks &quot;dd&quot;; offset
set to 8 <br>
recv(fd, buf, 2, 0); // Reads &quot;aa&quot;; offset set to
6 <br>
recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK); // Peeks &quot;ee&quot;; offset
set to 8</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PEERCRED</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Return the credentials of the
peer process connected to this socket. For further details,
see <b>unix</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PEERSEC</b> (since Linux
2.6.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Return the security context of
the peer socket connected to this socket. For further
details, see <b>unix</b>(7) and <b>ip</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PRIORITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the protocol-defined
priority for all packets to be sent on this socket. Linux
uses this value to order the networking queues: packets with
a higher priority may be processed first depending on the
selected device queueing discipline. Setting a priority
outside the range 0 to 6 requires the <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>
capability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PROTOCOL</b> (since Linux
2.6.32)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Retrieves the socket protocol
as an integer, returning a value such as
<b>IPPROTO_SCTP</b>. See <b>socket</b>(2) for details. This
socket option is read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_RCVBUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets or gets the maximum socket
receive buffer in bytes. The kernel doubles this value (to
allow space for bookkeeping overhead) when it is set using
<b>setsockopt</b>(2), and this doubled value is returned by
<b>getsockopt</b>(2). The default value is set by the
<i>/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default</i> file, and the maximum
allowed value is set by the
<i>/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max</i> file. The minimum
(doubled) value for this option is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_RCVBUFFORCE</b> (since
Linux 2.6.14)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Using this socket option, a
privileged (<b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>) process can perform the
same task as <b>SO_RCVBUF</b>, but the <i>rmem_max</i> limit
can be overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b> and
<b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the minimum number of
bytes in the buffer until the socket layer will pass the
data to the protocol (<b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b>) or the user on
receiving (<b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b>). These two values are
initialized to 1. <b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b> is not changeable on
Linux (<b>setsockopt</b>(2) fails with the error
<b>ENOPROTOOPT</b>). <b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b> is changeable only
since Linux 2.4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Before Linux
2.6.28 <b>select</b>(2), <b>poll</b>(2), and <b>epoll</b>(7)
did not respect the <b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b> setting on Linux, and
indicated a socket as readable when even a single byte of
data was available. A subsequent read from the socket would
then block until <b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b> bytes are available.
Since Linux 2.6.28, <b>select</b>(2), <b>poll</b>(2), and
<b>epoll</b>(7) indicate a socket as readable only if at
least <b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b> bytes are available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_RCVTIMEO</b> and
<b>SO_SNDTIMEO</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the receiving or
sending timeouts until reporting an error. The argument is a
<i>struct timeval</i>. If an input or output function blocks
for this period of time, and data has been sent or received,
the return value of that function will be the amount of data
transferred; if no data has been transferred and the timeout
has been reached, then -1 is returned with <i>errno</i> set
to <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>, or
<b>EINPROGRESS</b> (for <b>connect</b>(2)) just as if the
socket was specified to be nonblocking. If the timeout is
set to zero (the default), then the operation will never
timeout. Timeouts only have effect for system calls that
perform socket I/O (e.g., <b>read</b>(2), <b>recvmsg</b>(2),
<b>send</b>(2), <b>sendmsg</b>(2)); timeouts have no effect
for <b>select</b>(2), <b>poll</b>(2), <b>epoll_wait</b>(2),
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_REUSEADDR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Indicates that the rules used
in validating addresses supplied in a <b>bind</b>(2) call
should allow reuse of local addresses. For <b>AF_INET</b>
sockets this means that a socket may bind, except when there
is an active listening socket bound to the address. When the
listening socket is bound to <b>INADDR_ANY</b> with a
specific port then it is not possible to bind to this port
for any local address. Argument is an integer boolean
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_REUSEPORT</b> (since
Linux 3.9)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Permits multiple <b>AF_INET</b>
or <b>AF_INET6</b> sockets to be bound to an identical
socket address. This option must be set on each socket
(including the first socket) prior to calling <b>bind</b>(2)
on the socket. To prevent port hijacking, all of the
processes binding to the same address must have the same
effective UID. This option can be employed with both TCP and
UDP sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For TCP
sockets, this option allows <b>accept</b>(2) load
distribution in a multi-threaded server to be improved by
using a distinct listener socket for each thread. This
provides improved load distribution as compared to
traditional techniques such using a single
<b>accept</b>(2)ing thread that distributes connections, or
having multiple threads that compete to <b>accept</b>(2)
from the same socket.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For UDP
sockets, the use of this option can provide better
distribution of incoming datagrams to multiple processes (or
threads) as compared to the traditional technique of having
multiple processes compete to receive datagrams on the same
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_RXQ_OVFL</b> (since Linux
2.6.33)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Indicates that an unsigned
32-bit value ancillary message (cmsg) should be attached to
received skbs indicating the number of packets dropped by
the socket since its creation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_SELECT_ERR_QUEUE</b>
(since Linux 3.10)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When this option is set on a
socket, an error condition on a socket causes notification
not only via the <i>exceptfds</i> set of <b>select</b>(2).
Similarly, <b>poll</b>(2) also returns a <b>POLLPRI</b>
whenever an <b>POLLERR</b> event is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Background:
this option was added when waking up on an error condition
occurred only via the <i>readfds</i> and <i>writefds</i>
sets of <b>select</b>(2). The option was added to allow
monitoring for error conditions via the <i>exceptfds</i>
argument without simultaneously having to receive
notifications (via <i>readfds</i>) for regular data that can
be read from the socket. After changes in Linux 4.16, the
use of this flag to achieve the desired notifications is no
longer necessary. This option is nevertheless retained for
backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_SNDBUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets or gets the maximum socket
send buffer in bytes. The kernel doubles this value (to
allow space for bookkeeping overhead) when it is set using
<b>setsockopt</b>(2), and this doubled value is returned by
<b>getsockopt</b>(2). The default value is set by the
<i>/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default</i> file and the maximum
allowed value is set by the
<i>/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max</i> file. The minimum
(doubled) value for this option is 2048.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_SNDBUFFORCE</b> (since
Linux 2.6.14)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Using this socket option, a
privileged (<b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>) process can perform the
same task as <b>SO_SNDBUF</b>, but the <i>wmem_max</i> limit
can be overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_TIMESTAMP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable the receiving
of the <b>SO_TIMESTAMP</b> control message. The timestamp
control message is sent with level <b>SOL_SOCKET</b> and a
<i>cmsg_type</i> of <b>SCM_TIMESTAMP</b>. The
<i>cmsg_data</i> field is a <i>struct timeval</i> indicating
the reception time of the last packet passed to the user in
this call. See <b>cmsg</b>(3) for details on control
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_TIMESTAMPNS</b> (since
Linux 2.6.22)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable the receiving
of the <b>SO_TIMESTAMPNS</b> control message. The timestamp
control message is sent with level <b>SOL_SOCKET</b> and a
<i>cmsg_type</i> of <b>SCM_TIMESTAMPNS</b>. The
<i>cmsg_data</i> field is a <i>struct timespec</i>
indicating the reception time of the last packet passed to
the user in this call. The clock used for the timestamp is
<b>CLOCK_REALTIME</b>. See <b>cmsg</b>(3) for details on
control messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A socket cannot
mix <b>SO_TIMESTAMP</b> and <b>SO_TIMESTAMPNS</b>: the two
modes are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Gets the socket type as an
integer (e.g., <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>). This socket option is
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_BUSY_POLL</b> (since
Linux 3.11)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the approximate time in
microseconds to busy poll on a blocking receive when there
is no data. Increasing this value requires
<b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>. The default for this option is
controlled by the <i>/proc/sys/net/core/busy_read</i>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The value in
the <i>/proc/sys/net/core/busy_poll</i> file determines how
long <b>select</b>(2) and <b>poll</b>(2) will busy poll when
they operate on sockets with <b>SO_BUSY_POLL</b> set and no
events to report are found.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In both cases,
busy polling will only be done when the socket last received
data from a network device that supports this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">While busy
polling may improve latency of some applications, care must
be taken when using it since this will increase both CPU
utilization and power usage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Signals</b>
<br>
When writing onto a connection-oriented socket that has been
shut down (by the local or the remote end) <b>SIGPIPE</b> is
sent to the writing process and <b>EPIPE</b> is returned.
The signal is not sent when the write call specified the
<b>MSG_NOSIGNAL</b> flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When requested
with the <b>FIOSETOWN fcntl</b>(2) or <b>SIOCSPGRP
ioctl</b>(2), <b>SIGIO</b> is sent when an I/O event occurs.
It is possible to use <b>poll</b>(2) or <b>select</b>(2) in
the signal handler to find out which socket the event
occurred on. An alternative (in Linux 2.2) is to set a
real-time signal using the <b>F_SETSIG fcntl</b>(2); the
handler of the real time signal will be called with the file
descriptor in the <i>si_fd</i> field of its
<i>siginfo_t</i>. See <b>fcntl</b>(2) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under some
circumstances (e.g., multiple processes accessing a single
socket), the condition that caused the <b>SIGIO</b> may have
already disappeared when the process reacts to the signal.
If this happens, the process should wait again because Linux
will resend the signal later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/proc
interfaces</b> <br>
The core socket networking parameters can be accessed via
files in the directory <i>/proc/sys/net/core/</i>. <i><br>
rmem_default</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">contains the default setting in
bytes of the socket receive buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>rmem_max</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">contains the maximum socket
receive buffer size in bytes which a user may set by using
the <b>SO_RCVBUF</b> socket option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>wmem_default</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">contains the default setting in
bytes of the socket send buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>wmem_max</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">contains the maximum socket
send buffer size in bytes which a user may set by using the
<b>SO_SNDBUF</b> socket option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>message_cost</i> and
<i>message_burst</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">configure the token bucket
filter used to load limit warning messages caused by
external network events.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>netdev_max_backlog</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum number of packets in
the global input queue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>optmem_max</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum length of ancillary
data and user control data like the iovecs per socket.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Ioctls</b>
<br>
These operations can be accessed using <b>ioctl</b>(2):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i>error</i>
<b>= ioctl(</b><i>ip_socket</i><b>,</b>
<i>ioctl_type</i><b>,</b>
<i>&amp;value_result</i><b>);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIOCGSTAMP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Return a <i>struct timeval</i>
with the receive timestamp of the last packet passed to the
user. This is useful for accurate round trip time
measurements. See <b>setitimer</b>(2) for a description of
<i>struct timeval</i>. This ioctl should be used only if the
socket options <b>SO_TIMESTAMP</b> and <b>SO_TIMESTAMPNS</b>
are not set on the socket. Otherwise, it returns the
timestamp of the last packet that was received while
<b>SO_TIMESTAMP</b> and <b>SO_TIMESTAMPNS</b> were not set,
or it fails if no such packet has been received, (i.e.,
<b>ioctl</b>(2) returns -1 with <i>errno</i> set to
<b>ENOENT</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIOCSPGRP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the process or process
group that is to receive <b>SIGIO</b> or <b>SIGURG</b>
signals when I/O becomes possible or urgent data is
available. The argument is a pointer to a <i>pid_t</i>. For
further details, see the description of <b>F_SETOWN</b> in
<b>fcntl</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>FIOASYNC</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Change the <b>O_ASYNC</b> flag
to enable or disable asynchronous I/O mode of the socket.
Asynchronous I/O mode means that the <b>SIGIO</b> signal or
the signal set with <b>F_SETSIG</b> is raised when a new I/O
event occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Argument is an
integer boolean flag. (This operation is synonymous with the
use of <b>fcntl</b>(2) to set the <b>O_ASYNC</b> flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIOCGPGRP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Get the current process or
process group that receives <b>SIGIO</b> or <b>SIGURG</b>
signals, or 0 when none is set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Valid
<b>fcntl</b>(2) operations: <b><br>
FIOGETOWN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The same as the <b>SIOCGPGRP
ioctl</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>FIOSETOWN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The same as the <b>SIOCSPGRP
ioctl</b>(2).</p>

<h2>VERSIONS
<a name="VERSIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SO_BINDTODEVICE</b>
was introduced in Linux 2.0.30. <b>SO_PASSCRED</b> is new in
Linux 2.2. The <i>/proc</i> interfaces were introduced in
Linux 2.2. <b>SO_RCVTIMEO</b> and <b>SO_SNDTIMEO</b> are
supported since Linux 2.3.41. Earlier, timeouts were fixed
to a protocol-specific setting, and could not be read or
written.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux assumes
that half of the send/receive buffer is used for internal
kernel structures; thus the values in the corresponding
<i>/proc</i> files are twice what can be observed on the
wire.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux will
allow port reuse only with the <b>SO_REUSEADDR</b> option
when this option was set both in the previous program that
performed a <b>bind</b>(2) to the port and in the program
that wants to reuse the port. This differs from some
implementations (e.g., FreeBSD) where only the later program
needs to set the <b>SO_REUSEADDR</b> option. Typically this
difference is invisible, since, for example, a server
program is designed to always set this option.</p>
