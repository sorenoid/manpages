<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">deb-version -
Debian package version number format</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[<i>epoch</i><b>:</b>]<i>upstream-version</i>[<b>-</b><i>debian-revision</i>]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version numbers
as used for Debian binary and source packages consist of
three components. These are: <i><br>
epoch</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a single (generally
small) unsigned integer. It may be omitted, in which case
zero is assumed. If it is omitted then the
<i>upstream-version</i> may not contain any colons.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is provided
to allow mistakes in the version numbers of older versions
of a package, and also a package&rsquo;s previous version
numbering schemes, to be left behind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>upstream-version</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is the main part of the
version number. It is usually the version number of the
original (&ldquo;upstream&rdquo;) package from which the
<i>.deb</i> file has been made, if this is applicable.
Usually this will be in the same format as that specified by
the upstream author(s); however, it may need to be
reformatted to fit into the package management
system&rsquo;s format and comparison scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The comparison
behavior of the package management system with respect to
the <i>upstream-version</i> is described below. The
<i>upstream-version</i> portion of the version number is
mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>upstream-version</i> may contain only alphanumerics
(&ldquo;A-Za-z0-9&rdquo;) and the characters <b>. + - :
~</b> (full stop, plus, hyphen, colon, tilde) and should
start with a digit. If there is no <i>debian-revision</i>
then hyphens are not allowed; if there is no <i>epoch</i>
then colons are not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>debian-revision</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This part of the version number
specifies the version of the Debian package based on the
upstream version. It may contain only alphanumerics and the
characters <b>+ . ~</b> (plus, full stop, tilde) and is
compared in the same way as the <i>upstream-version</i>
is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is optional;
if it isn&rsquo;t present then the <i>upstream-version</i>
may not contain a hyphen. This format represents the case
where a piece of software was written specifically to be
turned into a Debian package, and so there is only one
&ldquo;debianization&rdquo; of it and therefore no revision
indication is required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is
conventional to restart the <i>debian-revision</i> at
&rsquo;1&rsquo; each time the <i>upstream-version</i> is
increased.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Dpkg will break
the version number apart at the last hyphen in the string
(if there is one) to determine the <i>upstream-version</i>
and <i>debian-revision</i>. The absence of a
<i>debian-revision</i> compares earlier than the presence of
one (but note that the <i>debian-revision</i> is the least
significant part of the version number).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Sorting
algorithm</b> <br>
The <i>upstream-version</i> and <i>debian-revision</i> parts
are compared by the package management system using the same
algorithm:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The strings are
compared from left to right.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First the
initial part of each string consisting entirely of non-digit
characters is determined. These two parts (one of which may
be empty) are compared lexically. If a difference is found
it is returned. The lexical comparison is a comparison of
<small>ASCII</small> values modified so that all the letters
sort earlier than all the non-letters and so that a tilde
sorts before anything, even the end of a part. For example,
the following parts are in sorted order: &rsquo;~~&rsquo;,
&rsquo;~~a&rsquo;, &rsquo;~&rsquo;, the empty part,
&rsquo;a&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then the
initial part of the remainder of each string which consists
entirely of digit characters is determined. The numerical
values of these two parts are compared, and any difference
found is returned as the result of the comparison. For these
purposes an empty string (which can only occur at the end of
one or both version strings being compared) counts as
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These two steps
(comparing and removing initial non-digit strings and
initial digit strings) are repeated until a difference is
found or both strings are exhausted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
purpose of epochs is to allow us to leave behind mistakes in
version numbering, and to cope with situations where the
version numbering scheme changes. It is <b>not</b> intended
to cope with version numbers containing strings of letters
which the package management system cannot interpret (such
as &rsquo;ALPHA&rsquo; or &rsquo;pre-&rsquo;), or with silly
orderings.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tilde
character and its special sorting properties were introduced
in dpkg 1.10 and some parts of the dpkg build scripts only
gained support for it later in the 1.10.x series.</p>
