<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">xattr -
Extended attributes</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extended
attributes are name:value pairs associated permanently with
files and directories, similar to the environment strings
associated with a process. An attribute may be defined or
undefined. If it is defined, its value may be empty or
non-empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extended
attributes are extensions to the normal attributes which are
associated with all inodes in the system (i.e., the
<b>stat</b>(2) data). They are often used to provide
additional functionality to a filesystem&mdash;for example,
additional security features such as Access Control Lists
(ACLs) may be implemented using extended attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Users with
search access to a file or directory may use
<b>listxattr</b>(2) to retrieve a list of attribute names
defined for that file or directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extended
attributes are accessed as atomic objects. Reading
(<b>getxattr</b>(2)) retrieves the whole value of an
attribute and stores it in a buffer. Writing
(<b>setxattr</b>(2)) replaces any previous value with the
new value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Space consumed
for extended attributes may be counted towards the disk
quotas of the file owner and file group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Extended
attribute namespaces</b> <br>
Attribute names are null-terminated strings. The attribute
name is always specified in the fully qualified
<i>namespace.attribute</i> form, for example,
<i>user.mime_type</i>, <i>trusted.md5sum</i>,
<i>system.posix_acl_access</i>, or
<i>security.selinux</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The namespace
mechanism is used to define different classes of extended
attributes. These different classes exist for several
reasons; for example, the permissions and capabilities
required for manipulating extended attributes of one
namespace may differ to another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently, the
<i>security</i>, <i>system</i>, <i>trusted</i>, and
<i>user</i> extended attribute classes are defined as
described below. Additional classes may be added in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Extended
security attributes</b> <br>
The security attribute namespace is used by kernel security
modules, such as Security Enhanced Linux, and also to
implement file capabilities (see <b>capabilities</b>(7)).
Read and write access permissions to security attributes
depend on the policy implemented for each security attribute
by the security module. When no security module is loaded,
all processes have read access to extended security
attributes, and write access is limited to processes that
have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>System
extended attributes</b> <br>
System extended attributes are used by the kernel to store
system objects such as Access Control Lists. Read and write
access permissions to system attributes depend on the policy
implemented for each system attribute implemented by
filesystems in the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Trusted
extended attributes</b> <br>
Trusted extended attributes are visible and accessible only
to processes that have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability.
Attributes in this class are used to implement mechanisms in
user space (i.e., outside the kernel) which keep information
in extended attributes to which ordinary processes should
not have access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>User
extended attributes</b> <br>
User extended attributes may be assigned to files and
directories for storing arbitrary additional information
such as the mime type, character set or encoding of a file.
The access permissions for user attributes are defined by
the file permission bits: read permission is required to
retrieve the attribute value, and writer permission is
required to change it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file
permission bits of regular files and directories are
interpreted differently from the file permission bits of
special files and symbolic links. For regular files and
directories the file permission bits define access to the
file&rsquo;s contents, while for device special files they
define access to the device described by the special file.
The file permissions of symbolic links are not used in
access checks. These differences would allow users to
consume filesystem resources in a way not controllable by
disk quotas for group or world writable special files and
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For this
reason, user extended attributes are allowed only for
regular files and directories, and access to user extended
attributes is restricted to the owner and to users with
appropriate capabilities for directories with the sticky bit
set (see the <b>chmod</b>(1) manual page for an explanation
of the sticky bit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Filesystem
differences</b> <br>
The kernel and the filesystem may place limits on the
maximum number and size of extended attributes that can be
associated with a file. The VFS imposes limitations that an
attribute names is limited to 255 bytes and an attribute
value is limited to 64&nbsp;kB. The list of attribute names
that can be returned is also limited to 64&nbsp;kB (see BUGS
in <b>listxattr</b>(2)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
filesystems, such as Reiserfs (and, historically, ext2 and
ext3), require the filesystem to be mounted with the
<b>user_xattr</b> mount option in order for user extended
attributes to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the current
ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystem implementations, the total
bytes used by the names and values of all of a file&rsquo;s
extended attributes must fit in a single filesystem block
(1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes, depending on the block size
specified when the filesystem was created).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the Btrfs,
XFS, and Reiserfs filesystem implementations, there is no
practical limit on the number of extended attributes
associated with a file, and the algorithms used to store
extended attribute information on disk are scalable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the JFS,
XFS, and Reiserfs filesystem implementations, the limit on
bytes used in an EA value is the ceiling imposed by the
VFS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the Btrfs
filesystem implementation, the total bytes used for the
name, value, and implementation overhead bytes is limited to
the filesystem <i>nodesize</i> value (16&nbsp;kB by
default).</p>

<h2>CONFORMING TO
<a name="CONFORMING TO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extended
attributes are not specified in POSIX.1, but some other
systems (e.g., the BSDs and Solaris) provide a similar
feature.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since the
filesystems on which extended attributes are stored might
also be used on architectures with a different byte order
and machine word size, care should be taken to store
attribute values in an architecture-independent format.</p>
