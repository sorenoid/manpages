<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">alternate
object database</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Via the alternates mechanism, a
repository can inherit part of its object database from
another object database, which is called an
&quot;alternate&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bare
repository</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A bare repository is normally
an appropriately named directory with a <b>.git</b> suffix
that does not have a locally checked-out copy of any of the
files under revision control. That is, all of the Git
administrative and control files that would normally be
present in the hidden <b>.git</b> sub-directory are directly
present in the <b>repository.git</b> directory instead, and
no other files are present and checked out. Usually
publishers of public repositories make bare repositories
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">blob object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Untyped object, e.g. the
contents of a file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">branch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;branch&quot; is a line
of development. The most recent commit on a branch is
referred to as the tip of that branch. The tip of the branch
is referenced by a branch head, which moves forward as
additional development is done on the branch. A single Git
repository can track an arbitrary number of branches, but
your working tree is associated with just one of them (the
&quot;current&quot; or &quot;checked out&quot; branch), and
HEAD points to that branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cache</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Obsolete for: index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">chain</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A list of objects, where each
object in the list contains a reference to its successor
(for example, the successor of a commit could be one of its
parents).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">changeset</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">BitKeeper/cvsps speak for
&quot;commit&quot;. Since Git does not store changes, but
states, it really does not make sense to use the term
&quot;changesets&quot; with Git.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">checkout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The action of updating all or
part of the working tree with a tree object or blob from the
object database, and updating the index and HEAD if the
whole working tree has been pointed at a new branch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cherry-picking</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In SCM jargon, &quot;cherry
pick&quot; means to choose a subset of changes out of a
series of changes (typically commits) and record them as a
new series of changes on top of a different codebase. In
Git, this is performed by the &quot;git cherry-pick&quot;
command to extract the change introduced by an existing
commit and to record it based on the tip of the current
branch as a new commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">clean</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A working tree is clean, if it
corresponds to the revision referenced by the current head.
Also see &quot;dirty&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">commit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As a noun: A single point in
the Git history; the entire history of a project is
represented as a set of interrelated commits. The word
&quot;commit&quot; is often used by Git in the same places
other revision control systems use the words
&quot;revision&quot; or &quot;version&quot;. Also used as a
short hand for commit object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a verb: The
action of storing a new snapshot of the project&rsquo;s
state in the Git history, by creating a new commit
representing the current state of the index and advancing
HEAD to point at the new commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">commit
object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An object which contains the
information about a particular revision, such as parents,
committer, author, date and the tree object which
corresponds to the top directory of the stored revision.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">commit-ish
(also committish)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A commit object or an object
that can be recursively dereferenced to a commit object. The
following are all commit-ishes: a commit object, a tag
object that points to a commit object, a tag object that
points to a tag object that points to a commit object,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">core Git</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Fundamental data structures and
utilities of Git. Exposes only limited source code
management tools.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DAG</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Directed acyclic graph. The
commit objects form a directed acyclic graph, because they
have parents (directed), and the graph of commit objects is
acyclic (there is no chain which begins and ends with the
same object).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dangling
object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An unreachable object which is
not reachable even from other unreachable objects; a
dangling object has no references to it from any reference
or object in the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">detached
HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Normally the HEAD stores the
name of a branch, and commands that operate on the history
HEAD represents operate on the history leading to the tip of
the branch the HEAD points at. However, Git also allows you
to check out an arbitrary commit that isn&rsquo;t
necessarily the tip of any particular branch. The HEAD in
such a state is called &quot;detached&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
commands that operate on the history of the current branch
(e.g. <b>git commit</b> to build a new history on top of it)
still work while the HEAD is detached. They update the HEAD
to point at the tip of the updated history without affecting
any branch. Commands that update or inquire information
<i>about</i> the current branch (e.g. <b>git branch
--set-upstream-to</b> that sets what remote-tracking branch
the current branch integrates with) obviously do not work,
as there is no (real) current branch to ask about in this
state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The list you get with
&quot;ls&quot; :-)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dirty</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A working tree is said to be
&quot;dirty&quot; if it contains modifications which have
not been committed to the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">evil merge</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An evil merge is a merge that
introduces changes that do not appear in any parent.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">fast-forward</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A fast-forward is a special
type of merge where you have a revision and you are
&quot;merging&quot; another branch's changes that happen to
be a descendant of what you have. In such a case, you do not
make a new merge commit but instead just update your branch
to point at the same revision as the branch you are merging.
This will happen frequently on a remote-tracking branch of a
remote repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">fetch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Fetching a branch means to get
the branch&rsquo;s head ref from a remote repository, to
find out which objects are missing from the local object
database, and to get them, too. See also
<b>git-fetch</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">file system</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Linus Torvalds originally
designed Git to be a user space file system, i.e. the
infrastructure to hold files and directories. That ensured
the efficiency and speed of Git.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Git archive</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synonym for repository (for
arch people).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gitfile</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A plain file <b>.git</b> at the
root of a working tree that points at the directory that is
the real repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">grafts</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Grafts enables two otherwise
different lines of development to be joined together by
recording fake ancestry information for commits. This way
you can make Git pretend the set of parents a commit has is
different from what was recorded when the commit was
created. Configured via the <b>.git/info/grafts</b>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
grafts mechanism is outdated and can lead to problems
transferring objects between repositories; see
<b>git-replace</b>(1) for a more flexible and robust system
to do the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Git&rsquo;s context, synonym
for object name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">head</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A named reference to the commit
at the tip of a branch. Heads are stored in a file in
<b>$GIT_DIR/refs/heads/</b> directory, except when using
packed refs. (See <b>git-pack-refs</b>(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The current branch. In more
detail: Your working tree is normally derived from the state
of the tree referred to by HEAD. HEAD is a reference to one
of the heads in your repository, except when using a
detached HEAD, in which case it directly references an
arbitrary commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">head ref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A synonym for head.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hook</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">During the normal execution of
several Git commands, call-outs are made to optional scripts
that allow a developer to add functionality or checking.
Typically, the hooks allow for a command to be pre-verified
and potentially aborted, and allow for a post-notification
after the operation is done. The hook scripts are found in
the <b>$GIT_DIR/hooks/</b> directory, and are enabled by
simply removing the <b>.sample</b> suffix from the filename.
In earlier versions of Git you had to make them
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A collection of files with stat
information, whose contents are stored as objects. The index
is a stored version of your working tree. Truth be told, it
can also contain a second, and even a third version of a
working tree, which are used when merging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">index entry</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The information regarding a
particular file, stored in the index. An index entry can be
unmerged, if a merge was started, but not yet finished (i.e.
if the index contains multiple versions of that file).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">master</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default development branch.
Whenever you create a Git repository, a branch named
&quot;master&quot; is created, and becomes the active
branch. In most cases, this contains the local development,
though that is purely by convention and is not required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As a verb: To bring the
contents of another branch (possibly from an external
repository) into the current branch. In the case where the
merged-in branch is from a different repository, this is
done by first fetching the remote branch and then merging
the result into the current branch. This combination of
fetch and merge operations is called a pull. Merging is
performed by an automatic process that identifies changes
made since the branches diverged, and then applies all those
changes together. In cases where changes conflict, manual
intervention may be required to complete the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a noun:
unless it is a fast-forward, a successful merge results in
the creation of a new commit representing the result of the
merge, and having as parents the tips of the merged
branches. This commit is referred to as a &quot;merge
commit&quot;, or sometimes just a &quot;merge&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The unit of storage in Git. It
is uniquely identified by the SHA-1 of its contents.
Consequently, an object cannot be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">object
database</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stores a set of
&quot;objects&quot;, and an individual object is identified
by its object name. The objects usually live in
<b>$GIT_DIR/objects/</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">object
identifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synonym for object name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">object name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The unique identifier of an
object. The object name is usually represented by a 40
character hexadecimal string. Also colloquially called
SHA-1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">object type</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One of the identifiers
&quot;commit&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;tag&quot; or
&quot;blob&quot; describing the type of an object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">octopus</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To merge more than two
branches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">origin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default upstream
repository. Most projects have at least one upstream project
which they track. By default <i>origin</i> is used for that
purpose. New upstream updates will be fetched into
remote-tracking branches named
origin/name-of-upstream-branch, which you can see using
<b>git branch -r</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">overlay</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only update and add files to
the working directory, but don&rsquo;t delete them, similar
to how <i>cp -R</i> would update the contents in the
destination directory. This is the default mode in a
checkout when checking out files from the index or a
tree-ish. In contrast, no-overlay mode also deletes tracked
files not present in the source, similar to <i>rsync
--delete</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A set of objects which have
been compressed into one file (to save space or to transmit
them efficiently).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pack index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The list of identifiers, and
other information, of the objects in a pack, to assist in
efficiently accessing the contents of a pack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pathspec</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pattern used to limit paths in
Git commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Pathspecs are
used on the command line of &quot;git ls-files&quot;,
&quot;git ls-tree&quot;, &quot;git add&quot;, &quot;git
grep&quot;, &quot;git diff&quot;, &quot;git checkout&quot;,
and many other commands to limit the scope of operations to
some subset of the tree or worktree. See the documentation
of each command for whether paths are relative to the
current directory or toplevel. The pathspec syntax is as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; any path
matches itself</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; the
pathspec up to the last slash represents a directory prefix.
The scope of that pathspec is limited to that subtree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; the rest
of the pathspec is a pattern for the remainder of the
pathname. Paths relative to the directory prefix will be
matched against that pattern using fnmatch(3); in
particular, <i>*</i> and <i>? can</i> match directory
separators.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
Documentation/*.jpg will match all .jpg files in the
Documentation subtree, including
Documentation/chapter_1/figure_1.jpg.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A pathspec that
begins with a colon <b>:</b> has special meaning. In the
short form, the leading colon <b>:</b> is followed by zero
or more &quot;magic signature&quot; letters (which
optionally is terminated by another colon <b>:</b>), and the
remainder is the pattern to match against the path. The
&quot;magic signature&quot; consists of ASCII symbols that
are neither alphanumeric, glob, regex special characters nor
colon. The optional colon that terminates the &quot;magic
signature&quot; can be omitted if the pattern begins with a
character that does not belong to &quot;magic
signature&quot; symbol set and is not a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In the long
form, the leading colon <b>:</b> is followed by an open
parenthesis <b>(</b>, a comma-separated list of zero or more
&quot;magic words&quot;, and a close parentheses <b>)</b>,
and the remainder is the pattern to match against the
path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A pathspec with
only a colon means &quot;there is no pathspec&quot;. This
form should not be combined with other pathspec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">top</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The magic word <b>top</b>
(magic signature: <b>/</b>) makes the pattern match from the
root of the working tree, even when you are running the
command from inside a subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">literal</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Wildcards in the pattern such
as <b>*</b> or <b>?</b> are treated as literal
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">icase</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Case insensitive match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">glob</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Git treats the pattern as a
shell glob suitable for consumption by fnmatch(3) with the
FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern will not match a
/ in the pathname. For example,
&quot;Documentation/*.html&quot; matches
&quot;Documentation/git.html&quot; but not
&quot;Documentation/ppc/ppc.html&quot; or
&quot;tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Two consecutive
asterisks (&quot;<b>**</b>&quot;) in patterns matched
against full pathname may have special meaning:</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A
leading &quot;<b>**</b>&quot; followed by a slash means
match in all directories. For example,
&quot;<b>**/foo</b>&quot; matches file or directory
&quot;<b>foo</b>&quot; anywhere, the same as pattern
&quot;<b>foo</b>&quot;. &quot;<b>**/foo/bar</b>&quot;
matches file or directory &quot;<b>bar</b>&quot; anywhere
that is directly under directory &quot;<b>foo</b>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A
trailing &quot;<b>/**</b>&quot; matches everything inside.
For example, &quot;<b>abc/**</b>&quot; matches all files
inside directory &quot;abc&quot;, relative to the location
of the <b>.gitignore</b> file, with infinite depth.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A slash
followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches
zero or more directories. For example,
&quot;<b>a/**/b</b>&quot; matches &quot;<b>a/b</b>&quot;,
&quot;<b>a/x/b</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>a/x/y/b</b>&quot; and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Other
consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">Glob magic is
incompatible with literal magic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">attr</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">After <b>attr:</b> comes a
space separated list of &quot;attribute requirements&quot;,
all of which must be met in order for the path to be
considered a match; this is in addition to the usual
non-magic pathspec pattern matching. See
<b>gitattributes</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Each of the
attribute requirements for the path takes one of these
forms:</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;<b>ATTR</b>&quot; requires that the attribute
<b>ATTR</b> be set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;<b>-ATTR</b>&quot; requires that the attribute
<b>ATTR</b> be unset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;<b>ATTR=VALUE</b>&quot; requires that the attribute
<b>ATTR</b> be set to the string <b>VALUE</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;<b>!ATTR</b>&quot; requires that the attribute
<b>ATTR</b> be unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
matching against a tree object, attributes are still
obtained from working tree, not from the given tree
object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">exclude</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">After a path matches any
non-exclude pathspec, it will be run through all exclude
pathspecs (magic signature: <b>!</b> or its synonym
<b>^</b>). If it matches, the path is ignored. When there is
no non-exclude pathspec, the exclusion is applied to the
result set as if invoked without any pathspec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">parent</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A commit object contains a
(possibly empty) list of the logical predecessor(s) in the
line of development, i.e. its parents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pickaxe</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The term pickaxe refers to an
option to the diffcore routines that help select changes
that add or delete a given text string. With the
<b>--pickaxe-all</b> option, it can be used to view the full
changeset that introduced or removed, say, a particular line
of text. See <b>git-diff</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">plumbing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Cute name for core Git.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">porcelain</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Cute name for programs and
program suites depending on core Git, presenting a high
level access to core Git. Porcelains expose more of a SCM
interface than the plumbing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">per-worktree
ref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Refs that are per-worktree,
rather than global. This is presently only HEAD and any refs
that start with <b>refs/bisect/</b>, but might later include
other unusual refs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pseudoref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pseudorefs are a class of files
under <b>$GIT_DIR</b> which behave like refs for the
purposes of rev-parse, but which are treated specially by
git. Pseudorefs both have names that are all-caps, and
always start with a line consisting of a SHA-1 followed by
whitespace. So, HEAD is not a pseudoref, because it is
sometimes a symbolic ref. They might optionally contain some
additional data. <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> and
<b>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</b> are examples. Unlike per-worktree
refs, these files cannot be symbolic refs, and never have
reflogs. They also cannot be updated through the normal ref
update machinery. Instead, they are updated by directly
writing to the files. However, they can be read as if they
were refs, so <b>git rev-parse MERGE_HEAD</b> will work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pull</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pulling a branch means to fetch
it and merge it. See also <b>git-pull</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">push</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pushing a branch means to get
the branch&rsquo;s head ref from a remote repository, find
out if it is an ancestor to the branch&rsquo;s local head
ref, and in that case, putting all objects, which are
reachable from the local head ref, and which are missing
from the remote repository, into the remote object database,
and updating the remote head ref. If the remote head is not
an ancestor to the local head, the push fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">reachable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All of the ancestors of a given
commit are said to be &quot;reachable&quot; from that
commit. More generally, one object is reachable from another
if we can reach the one from the other by a chain that
follows tags to whatever they tag, commits to their parents
or trees, and trees to the trees or blobs that they
contain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rebase</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To reapply a series of changes
from a branch to a different base, and reset the head of
that branch to the result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A name that begins with
<b>refs/</b> (e.g. <b>refs/heads/master</b>) that points to
an object name or another ref (the latter is called a
symbolic ref). For convenience, a ref can sometimes be
abbreviated when used as an argument to a Git command; see
<b>gitrevisions</b>(7) for details. Refs are stored in the
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The ref
namespace is hierarchical. Different subhierarchies are used
for different purposes (e.g. the <b>refs/heads/</b>
hierarchy is used to represent local branches).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There are a few
special-purpose refs that do not begin with <b>refs/</b>.
The most notable example is <b>HEAD</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">reflog</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A reflog shows the local
&quot;history&quot; of a ref. In other words, it can tell
you what the 3rd last revision in <i>this</i> repository
was, and what was the current state in <i>this</i>
repository, yesterday 9:14pm. See <b>git-reflog</b>(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">refspec</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;refspec&quot; is used
by fetch and push to describe the mapping between remote ref
and local ref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">remote
repository</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A repository which is used to
track the same project but resides somewhere else. To
communicate with remotes, see fetch or push.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">remote-tracking
branch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A ref that is used to follow
changes from another repository. It typically looks like
<i>refs/remotes/foo/bar</i> (indicating that it tracks a
branch named <i>bar</i> in a remote named <i>foo</i>), and
matches the right-hand-side of a configured fetch refspec. A
remote-tracking branch should not contain direct
modifications or have local commits made to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">repository</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A collection of refs together
with an object database containing all objects which are
reachable from the refs, possibly accompanied by meta data
from one or more porcelains. A repository can share an
object database with other repositories via alternates
mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">resolve</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The action of fixing up
manually what a failed automatic merge left behind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">revision</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synonym for commit (the
noun).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rewind</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To throw away part of the
development, i.e. to assign the head to an earlier
revision.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCM</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Source code management
(tool).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SHA-1</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;Secure Hash Algorithm
1&quot;; a cryptographic hash function. In the context of
Git used as a synonym for object name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">shallow
clone</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mostly a synonym to shallow
repository but the phrase makes it more explicit that it was
created by running <b>git clone --depth=...</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">shallow
repository</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A shallow repository has an
incomplete history some of whose commits have parents
cauterized away (in other words, Git is told to pretend that
these commits do not have the parents, even though they are
recorded in the commit object). This is sometimes useful
when you are interested only in the recent history of a
project even though the real history recorded in the
upstream is much larger. A shallow repository is created by
giving the <b>--depth</b> option to <b>git-clone</b>(1), and
its history can be later deepened with
<b>git-fetch</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">stash entry</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An object used to temporarily
store the contents of a dirty working directory and the
index for future reuse.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">submodule</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A repository that holds the
history of a separate project inside another repository (the
latter of which is called superproject).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">superproject</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A repository that references
repositories of other projects in its working tree as
submodules. The superproject knows about the names of (but
does not hold copies of) commit objects of the contained
submodules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">symref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Symbolic reference: instead of
containing the SHA-1 id itself, it is of the format <i>ref:
refs/some/thing</i> and when referenced, it recursively
dereferences to this reference. <i>HEAD</i> is a prime
example of a symref. Symbolic references are manipulated
with the <b>git-symbolic-ref</b>(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tag</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A ref under <b>refs/tags/</b>
namespace that points to an object of an arbitrary type
(typically a tag points to either a tag or a commit object).
In contrast to a head, a tag is not updated by the
<b>commit</b> command. A Git tag has nothing to do with a
Lisp tag (which would be called an object type in
Git&rsquo;s context). A tag is most typically used to mark a
particular point in the commit ancestry chain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tag object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An object containing a ref
pointing to another object, which can contain a message just
like a commit object. It can also contain a (PGP) signature,
in which case it is called a &quot;signed tag
object&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">topic
branch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A regular Git branch that is
used by a developer to identify a conceptual line of
development. Since branches are very easy and inexpensive,
it is often desirable to have several small branches that
each contain very well defined concepts or small incremental
yet related changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Either a working tree, or a
tree object together with the dependent blob and tree
objects (i.e. a stored representation of a working
tree).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tree object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An object containing a list of
file names and modes along with refs to the associated blob
and/or tree objects. A tree is equivalent to a
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tree-ish (also
treeish)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A tree object or an object that
can be recursively dereferenced to a tree object.
Dereferencing a commit object yields the tree object
corresponding to the revision's top directory. The following
are all tree-ishes: a commit-ish, a tree object, a tag
object that points to a tree object, a tag object that
points to a tag object that points to a tree object,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">unmerged
index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An index which contains
unmerged index entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">unreachable
object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An object which is not
reachable from a branch, tag, or any other reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">upstream
branch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default branch that is
merged into the branch in question (or the branch in
question is rebased onto). It is configured via
branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge. If
the upstream branch of <i>A</i> is <i>origin/B</i> sometimes
we say &quot;<i>A</i> is tracking <i>origin/B</i>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">working
tree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The tree of actual checked out
files. The working tree normally contains the contents of
the HEAD commit&rsquo;s tree, plus any local changes that
you have made but not yet committed.</p>
