<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>bootup

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each of these
is described below in more detail.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Hardware</b>
<br>
After power-on or hard reset, control is given to a program
stored in read-only memory (normally PROM); for historical
reasons involving the personal computer, this program is
often called &quot;the <b>BIOS</b>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program
normally performs a basic self-test of the machine and
accesses nonvolatile memory to read further parameters. This
memory in the PC is battery-backed CMOS memory, so most
people refer to it as &quot;the <b>CMOS</b>&quot;; outside
of the PC world, it is usually called &quot;the
<b>NVRAM</b>&quot; (nonvolatile RAM).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The parameters
stored in the NVRAM vary among systems, but as a minimum,
they should specify which device can supply an OS loader, or
at least which devices may be probed for one; such a device
is known as &quot;the <b>boot device</b>&quot;. The hardware
boot stage loads the OS loader from a fixed position on the
boot device, and then transfers control to it.</p>

<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device from which the OS
loader is read may be attached via a network, in which case
the details of booting are further specified by protocols
such as DHCP, TFTP, PXE, Etherboot, etc.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>OS
loader</b> <br>
The main job of the OS loader is to locate the kernel on
some device, load it, and run it. Most OS loaders allow
interactive use, in order to enable specification of an
alternative kernel (maybe a backup in case the one last
compiled isn&rsquo;t functioning) and to pass optional
parameters to the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a
traditional PC, the OS loader is located in the initial
512-byte block of the boot device; this block is known as
&quot;the <b>MBR</b>&quot; (Master Boot Record).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In most
systems, the OS loader is very limited due to various
constraints. Even on non-PC systems, there are some
limitations on the size and complexity of this loader, but
the size limitation of the PC MBR (512 bytes, including the
partition table) makes it almost impossible to squeeze much
functionality into it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore, most
systems split the role of loading the OS between a primary
OS loader and a secondary OS loader; this secondary OS
loader may be located within a larger portion of persistent
storage, such as a disk partition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Linux, the
OS loader is often either <b>lilo</b>(8) or
<b>grub</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Kernel</b>
<br>
When the kernel is loaded, it initializes various components
of the computer and operating system; each portion of
software responsible for such a task is usually consider
&quot;a <b>driver</b>&quot; for the applicable component.
The kernel starts the virtual memory swapper (it is a kernel
process, called &quot;kswapd&quot; in a modern Linux
kernel), and mounts some filesystem at the root path,
<i>/</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some of the
parameters that may be passed to the kernel relate to these
activities (for example, the default root filesystem can be
overridden); for further information on Linux kernel
parameters, read <a href="https://man.page/7/bootparam">bootparam(7)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only then does
the kernel create the initial userland process, which is
given the number 1 as its <b>PID</b> (process ID).
Traditionally, this process executes the program
<i>/sbin/init</i>, to which are passed the parameters that
haven&rsquo;t already been handled by the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Root
user-space process</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following description
applies to an OS based on UNIX System V Release 4. However,
a number of widely used systems have adopted a related but
fundamentally different approach known as <a href="https://man.page/1/systemd">systemd(1)</a>,
for which the bootup process is detailed in its associated
<a href="https://man.page/7/bootup">bootup(7)</a>.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<i>/sbin/init</i> starts, it reads <i>/etc/inittab</i> for
further instructions. This file defines what should be run
when the <i>/sbin/init</i> program is instructed to enter a
particular <i>run-level</i>, giving the administrator an
easy way to establish an environment for some usage; each
run-level is associated with a set of services (for example,
run-level <b>S</b> is <i>single-user</i> mode, and run-level
<b>2</b> entails running most network services).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
administrator may change the current run-level via
<a href="https://man.page/1/init">init(1)</a>, and query the current run-level via
<b>runlevel</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, since
it is not convenient to manage individual services by
editing this file, <i>/etc/inittab</i> only bootstraps a set
of scripts that actually start/stop the individual
services.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Boot
scripts</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following description
applies to an OS based on UNIX System V Release 4. However,
a number of widely used systems (Slackware Linux, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD) have a somewhat different scheme for boot
scripts.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each
managed service (mail, nfs server, cron, etc.), there is a
single startup script located in a specific directory
(<i>/etc/init.d</i> in most versions of Linux). Each of
these scripts accepts as a single argument the word
&quot;start&quot; (causing it to start the service) or the
word &quot;stop&quot; (causing it to stop the service). The
script may optionally accept other &quot;convenience&quot;
parameters (e.g., &quot;restart&quot; to stop and then
start, &quot;status&quot; to display the service status,
etc.). Running the script without parameters displays the
possible arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Sequencing
directories</b> <br>
To make specific scripts start/stop at specific run-levels
and in a specific order, there are <i>sequencing
directories</i>, normally of the form
<i>/etc/rc[0-6S].d</i>. In each of these directories, there
are links (usually symbolic) to the scripts in the
<i>/etc/init.d</i> directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A primary
script (usually <i>/etc/rc</i>) is called from
<a href="https://man.page/5/inittab">inittab(5)</a>; this primary script calls each
service&rsquo;s script via a link in the relevant sequencing
directory. Each link whose name begins with 'S' is called
with the argument &quot;start&quot; (thereby starting the
service). Each link whose name begins with 'K' is called
with the argument &quot;stop&quot; (thereby stopping the
service).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To define the
starting or stopping order within the same run-level, the
name of a link contains an <b>order-number</b>. Also, for
clarity, the name of a link usually ends with the name of
the service to which it refers. For example, the link
<i>/etc/rc2.d/S80sendmail</i> starts the sendmail service on
runlevel 2. This happens after <i>/etc/rc2.d/S12syslog</i>
is run but before <i>/etc/rc2.d/S90xfs</i> is run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To manage these
links is to manage the boot order and run-levels; under many
systems, there are tools to help with this task (e.g.,
<b>chkconfig</b>(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Boot
configuration</b> <br>
A program that provides a service is often called a
&quot;<b>daemon</b>&quot;. Usually, a daemon may receive
various command-line options and parameters. To allow a
system administrator to change these inputs without editing
an entire boot script, some separate configuration file is
used, and is located in a specific directory where an
associated boot script may find it (<i>/etc/sysconfig</i> on
older Red Hat systems).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In older UNIX
systems, such a file contained the actual command line
options for a daemon, but in modern Linux systems (and also
in HP-UX), it just contains shell variables. A boot script
in <i>/etc/init.d</i> reads and includes its configuration
file (that is, it &quot;<b>sources</b>&quot; its
configuration file) and then uses the variable values.</p>
