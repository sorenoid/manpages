<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">glob - globbing
pathnames</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Long ago, in
UNIX&nbsp;V6, there was a program <i>/etc/glob</i> that
would expand wildcard patterns. Soon afterward this became a
shell built-in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These days
there is also a library routine <a href="https://man.page/3/glob">glob(3)</a> that will
perform this function for a user program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The rules are
as follows (POSIX.2, 3.13).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Wildcard
matching</b> <br>
A string is a wildcard pattern if it contains one of the
characters '?', '*' or '['. Globbing is the operation that
expands a wildcard pattern into the list of pathnames
matching the pattern. Matching is defined by:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A '?' (not
between brackets) matches any single character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A '*' (not
between brackets) matches any string, including the empty
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Character
classes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An expression
&quot;<i>[...]</i>&quot; where the first character after the
leading '[' is not an '!' matches a single character, namely
any of the characters enclosed by the brackets. The string
enclosed by the brackets cannot be empty; therefore ']' can
be allowed between the brackets, provided that it is the
first character. (Thus, &quot;<i>[][!]</i>&quot; matches the
three characters '[', ']' and '!'.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Ranges</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is one
special convention: two characters separated by '-' denote a
range. (Thus, &quot;<i>[A-Fa-f0-9]</i>&quot; is equivalent
to &quot;<i>[ABCDEFabcdef0123456789]</i>&quot;.) One may
include '-' in its literal meaning by making it the first or
last character between the brackets. (Thus,
&quot;<i>[]-]</i>&quot; matches just the two characters ']'
and '-', and &quot;<i>[--0]</i>&quot; matches the three
characters '-', '.', '0', since '/' cannot be matched.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Complementation</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An expression
&quot;<i>[!...]</i>&quot; matches a single character, namely
any character that is not matched by the expression obtained
by removing the first '!' from it. (Thus,
&quot;<i>[!]a-]</i>&quot; matches any single character
except ']', 'a' and '-'.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One can remove
the special meaning of '?', '*' and '[' by preceding them by
a backslash, or, in case this is part of a shell command
line, enclosing them in quotes. Between brackets these
characters stand for themselves. Thus,
&quot;<i>[[?*\]</i>&quot; matches the four characters '[',
'?', '*' and '\'.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pathnames</b>
<br>
Globbing is applied on each of the components of a pathname
separately. A '/' in a pathname cannot be matched by a '?'
or '*' wildcard, or by a range like
&quot;<i>[.-0]</i>&quot;. A range containing an explicit '/'
character is syntactically incorrect. (POSIX requires that
syntactically incorrect patterns are left unchanged.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a filename
starts with a '.', this character must be matched
explicitly. (Thus, <i>rm&nbsp;*</i> will not remove
.profile, and <i>tar&nbsp;c&nbsp;*</i> will not archive all
your files; <i>tar&nbsp;c&nbsp;.</i> is better.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Empty
lists</b> <br>
The nice and simple rule given above: &quot;expand a
wildcard pattern into the list of matching pathnames&quot;
was the original UNIX definition. It allowed one to have
patterns that expand into an empty list, as in</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">xv -wait 0
*.gif *.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where perhaps
no *.gif files are present (and this is not an error).
However, POSIX requires that a wildcard pattern is left
unchanged when it is syntactically incorrect, or the list of
matching pathnames is empty. With <i>bash</i> one can force
the classical behavior using this command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">shopt -s
nullglob</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Similar
problems occur elsewhere. For example, where old scripts
have</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rm `find .
-name &quot;*~&quot;`</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">new scripts
require</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rm -f
nosuchfile `find . -name &quot;*~&quot;`</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to avoid error
messages from <i>rm</i> called with an empty argument
list.)</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Regular
expressions</b> <br>
Note that wildcard patterns are not regular expressions,
although they are a bit similar. First of all, they match
filenames, rather than text, and secondly, the conventions
are not the same: for example, in a regular expression '*'
means zero or more copies of the preceding thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now that
regular expressions have bracket expressions where the
negation is indicated by a '^', POSIX has declared the
effect of a wildcard pattern &quot;<i>[^...]</i>&quot; to be
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Character
classes and internationalization</b> <br>
Of course ranges were originally meant to be ASCII ranges,
so that &quot;<i>[&nbsp;-%]</i>&quot; stands for
&quot;<i>[&nbsp;!&quot;#$%]</i>&quot; and
&quot;<i>[a-z]</i>&quot; stands for &quot;any lowercase
letter&quot;. Some UNIX implementations generalized this so
that a range X-Y stands for the set of characters with code
between the codes for X and for Y. However, this requires
the user to know the character coding in use on the local
system, and moreover, is not convenient if the collating
sequence for the local alphabet differs from the ordering of
the character codes. Therefore, POSIX extended the bracket
notation greatly, both for wildcard patterns and for regular
expressions. In the above we saw three types of items that
can occur in a bracket expression: namely (i) the negation,
(ii) explicit single characters, and (iii) ranges. POSIX
specifies ranges in an internationally more useful way and
adds three more types:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(iii) Ranges
X-Y comprise all characters that fall between X and Y
(inclusive) in the current collating sequence as defined by
the <b>LC_COLLATE</b> category in the current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(iv) Named
character classes, like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[:alnum:]
[:alpha:] [:blank:] [:cntrl:] <br>
[:digit:] [:graph:] [:lower:] [:print:] <br>
[:punct:] [:space:] [:upper:] [:xdigit:]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">so that one can
say &quot;<i>[[:lower:]]</i>&quot; instead of
&quot;<i>[a-z]</i>&quot;, and have things work in Denmark,
too, where there are three letters past 'z' in the alphabet.
These character classes are defined by the <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
category in the current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(v) Collating
symbols, like &quot;<i>[.ch.]</i>&quot; or
&quot;<i>[.a-acute.]</i>&quot;, where the string between
&quot;<i>[.</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>.]</i>&quot; is a
collating element defined for the current locale. Note that
this may be a multicharacter element.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(vi)
Equivalence class expressions, like
&quot;<i>[=a=]</i>&quot;, where the string between
&quot;<i>[=</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>=]</i>&quot; is any
collating element from its equivalence class, as defined for
the current locale. For example, &quot;<i>[[=a=]]</i>&quot;
might be equivalent to
&quot;<i>[a&aacute;a&auml;&acirc;]</i>&quot;, that is, to
&quot;<i>[a[.a-acute.][.a-grave.][.a-umlaut.][.a-circumflex.]]</i>&quot;.</p>
