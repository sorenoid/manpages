<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gitfaq -
Frequently asked questions about using Git</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gitfaq</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The examples in
this FAQ assume a standard POSIX shell, like <b>bash</b> or
<b>dash</b>, and a user, A U Thor, who has the account
<b>author</b> on the hosting provider
<b>git.example.org</b>.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What should I
put in <b>user.name</b>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">You should put your personal
name, generally a form using a given name and family name.
For example, the current maintainer of Git uses &quot;Junio
C Hamano&quot;. This will be the name portion that is stored
in every commit you make.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This
configuration doesn&rsquo;t have any effect on
authenticating to remote services; for that, see
<b>credential.username</b> in <a href="https://man.page/1/git-config">git-config(1)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What does
<b>http.postBuffer</b> really do?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option changes the size of
the buffer that Git uses when pushing data to a remote over
HTTP or HTTPS. If the data is larger than this size,
libcurl, which handles the HTTP support for Git, will use
chunked transfer encoding since it isn&rsquo;t known ahead
of time what the size of the pushed data will be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Leaving this
value at the default size is fine unless you know that
either the remote server or a proxy in the middle
doesn&rsquo;t support HTTP/1.1 (which introduced the chunked
transfer encoding) or is known to be broken with chunked
data. This is often (erroneously) suggested as a solution
for generic push problems, but since almost every server and
proxy supports at least HTTP/1.1, raising this value usually
doesn&rsquo;t solve most push problems. A server or proxy
that didn&rsquo;t correctly support HTTP/1.1 and chunked
transfer encoding wouldn&rsquo;t be that useful on the
Internet today, since it would break lots of traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
increasing this value will increase the memory used on every
relevant push that Git does over HTTP or HTTPS, since the
entire buffer is allocated regardless of whether or not it
is all used. Thus, it&rsquo;s best to leave it at the
default unless you are sure you need a different value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How do I
configure a different editor?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you haven&rsquo;t specified
an editor specifically for Git, it will by default use the
editor you&rsquo;ve configured using the <b>VISUAL</b> or
<b>EDITOR</b> environment variables, or if neither is
specified, the system default (which is usually <b>vi</b>).
Since some people find <b>vi</b> difficult to use or prefer
a different editor, it may be desirable to change the editor
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
configure a general editor for most programs which need one,
you can edit your shell configuration (e.g.,
<b>~/.bashrc</b> or <b>~/.zshenv</b>) to contain a line
setting the <b>EDITOR</b> or <b>VISUAL</b> environment
variable to an appropriate value. For example, if you prefer
the editor <b>nano</b>, then you could write the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">export
VISUAL=nano</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
configure an editor specifically for Git, you can either set
the <b>core.editor</b> configuration value or the
<b>GIT_EDITOR</b> environment variable. You can see
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-var">git-var(1)</a> for details on the order in which these
options are consulted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
all cases, the editor value will be passed to the shell, so
any arguments containing spaces should be appropriately
quoted. Additionally, if your editor normally detaches from
the terminal when invoked, you should specify it with an
argument that makes it not do that, or else Git will not see
any changes. An example of a configuration addressing both
of these issues on Windows would be the configuration
<b>&quot;C:\Program Files\Vim\gvim.exe&quot; --nofork</b>,
which quotes the filename with spaces and specifies the
<b>--nofork</b> option to avoid backgrounding the
process.</p>

<h2>CREDENTIALS
<a name="CREDENTIALS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How do I
specify my credentials when pushing over HTTP?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The easiest way to do this is
to use a credential helper via the <b>credential.helper</b>
configuration. Most systems provide a standard choice to
integrate with the system credential manager. For example,
Git for Windows provides the <b>wincred</b> credential
manager, macOS has the <b>osxkeychain</b> credential
manager, and Unix systems with a standard desktop
environment can use the <b>libsecret</b> credential manager.
All of these store credentials in an encrypted store to keep
your passwords or tokens secure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
you can use the <b>store</b> credential manager which stores
in a file in your home directory, or the <b>cache</b>
credential manager, which does not permanently store your
credentials, but does prevent you from being prompted for
them for a certain period of time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
just enter your password when prompted. While it is possible
to place the password (which must be percent-encoded) in the
URL, this is not particularly secure and can lead to
accidental exposure of credentials, so it is not
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How do I read a
password or token from an environment variable?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <b>credential.helper</b>
configuration option can also take an arbitrary shell
command that produces the credential protocol on standard
output. This is useful when passing credentials into a
container, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Such a shell
command can be specified by starting the option value with
an exclamation point. If your password or token were stored
in the <b>GIT_TOKEN</b>, you could run the following command
to set your credential helper:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git config
credential.helper \ <br>
'!f() { echo username=author; echo
&quot;password=$GIT_TOKEN&quot;; };f'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How do I change
the password or token I&rsquo;ve saved in my credential
manager?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually, if the password or
token is invalid, Git will erase it and prompt for a new
one. However, there are times when this doesn&rsquo;t always
happen. To change the password or token, you can erase the
existing credentials and then Git will prompt for new ones.
To erase credentials, use a syntax like the following
(substituting your username and the hostname):</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ echo
url=https://author@git.example.org | git credential
reject</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How do I use
multiple accounts with the same hosting provider using
HTTP?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually the easiest way to
distinguish between these accounts is to use the username in
the URL. For example, if you have the accounts <b>author</b>
and <b>committer</b> on <b>git.example.org</b>, you can use
the URLs
<b><font color="#0000FF">https://author@git.example.org/org1/project1.git</font></b>
<font color="#000000">and</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">https://committer@git.example.org/org2/project2.git</font></b><font color="#000000">.
This way, when you use a credential helper, it will
automatically try to look up the correct credentials for
your account. If you already have a remote set up, you can
change the URL with something like <b>git remote set-url
origin https://author@git.example.org/org1/project1.git</b>
(see <a href="https://man.page/1/git-remote">git-remote(1)</a> for details).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">How
do I use multiple accounts with the same hosting provider
using SSH?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">With most
hosting providers that support SSH, a single key pair
uniquely identifies a user. Therefore, to use multiple
accounts, it&rsquo;s necessary to create a key pair for each
account. If you&rsquo;re using a reasonably modern OpenSSH
version, you can create a new key pair with something like
<b>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_committer</b>. You can
then register the public key (in this case,
<b>~/.ssh/id_committer.pub</b>; note the <b>.pub</b>) with
the hosting provider.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Most
hosting providers use a single SSH account for pushing; that
is, all users push to the <b>git</b> account (e.g.,
<b>git@git.example.org</b>). If that&rsquo;s the case for
your provider, you can set up multiple aliases in SSH to
make it clear which key pair to use. For example, you could
write something like the following in <b>~/.ssh/config</b>,
substituting the proper private key file:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">#
This is the account for author on git.example.org. <br>
Host example_author <br>
HostName git.example.org <br>
User git <br>
# This is the key pair registered for author with
git.example.org. <br>
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_author <br>
IdentitiesOnly yes <br>
# This is the account for committer on git.example.org. <br>
Host example_committer <br>
HostName git.example.org <br>
User git <br>
# This is the key pair registered for committer with
git.example.org. <br>
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_committer <br>
IdentitiesOnly yes</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Then,
you can adjust your push URL to use
<b>git@example_author</b> or <b>git@example_committer</b>
instead of <b>git@example.org</b> (e.g., <b>git remote
set-url
git@example_author:org1/project1.git</b>).</font></p>

<h2>COMMON ISSUES
<a name="COMMON ISSUES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">I&rsquo;ve
made a mistake in the last commit. How do I change
it?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">You can
make the appropriate change to your working tree, run <b>git
add &lt;file&gt;</b> or <b>git rm &lt;file&gt;</b>, as
appropriate, to stage it, and then <b>git commit
--amend</b>. Your change will be included in the commit, and
you&rsquo;ll be prompted to edit the commit message again;
if you wish to use the original message verbatim, you can
use the <b>--no-edit</b> option to <b>git commit</b> in
addition, or just save and quit when your editor
opens.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">I&rsquo;ve
made a change with a bug and it&rsquo;s been included in the
main branch. How should I undo it?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The usual
way to deal with this is to use <b>git revert</b>. This
preserves the history that the original change was made and
was a valuable contribution, but also introduces a new
commit that undoes those changes because the original had a
problem. The commit message of the revert indicates the
commit which was reverted and is usually edited to include
an explanation as to why the revert was made.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">How
do I ignore changes to a tracked file?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Git
doesn&rsquo;t provide a way to do this. The reason is that
if Git needs to overwrite this file, such as during a
checkout, it doesn&rsquo;t know whether the changes to the
file are precious and should be kept, or whether they are
irrelevant and can safely be destroyed. Therefore, it has to
take the safe route and always preserve them.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">It&rsquo;s
tempting to try to use certain features of <b>git
update-index</b>, namely the assume-unchanged and
skip-worktree bits, but these don&rsquo;t work properly for
this purpose and shouldn&rsquo;t be used this
way.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
your goal is to modify a configuration file, it can often be
helpful to have a file checked into the repository which is
a template or set of defaults which can then be copied
alongside and modified as appropriate. This second, modified
file is usually ignored to prevent accidentally committing
it.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">I
asked Git to ignore various files, yet they are still
tracked</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A
<b>gitignore</b> file ensures that certain file(s) which are
not tracked by Git remain untracked. However, sometimes
particular file(s) may have been tracked before adding them
into the <b>.gitignore</b>, hence they still remain tracked.
To untrack and ignore files/patterns, use <b>git rm --cached
&lt;file/pattern&gt;</b> and add a pattern to
<b>.gitignore</b> that matches the &lt;file&gt;. See
<a href="https://man.page/5/gitignore">gitignore(5)</a> for details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">How
do I know if I want to do a fetch or a pull?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A fetch
stores a copy of the latest changes from the remote
repository, without modifying the working tree or current
branch. You can then at your leisure inspect, merge, rebase
on top of, or ignore the upstream changes. A pull consists
of a fetch followed immediately by either a merge or rebase.
See <a href="https://man.page/1/git-pull">git-pull(1)</a>.</font></p>

<h2>MERGING AND REBASING
<a name="MERGING AND REBASING"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">What
kinds of problems can occur when merging long-lived branches
with squash merges?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">In
general, there are a variety of problems that can occur when
using squash merges to merge two branches multiple times.
These can include seeing extra commits in <b>git log</b>
output, with a GUI, or when using the <b>...</b> notation to
express a range, as well as the possibility of needing to
re-resolve conflicts again and again.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
Git does a normal merge between two branches, it considers
exactly three points: the two branches and a third commit,
called the <i>merge base</i>, which is usually the common
ancestor of the commits. The result of the merge is the sum
of the changes between the merge base and each head. When
you merge two branches with a regular merge commit, this
results in a new commit which will end up as a merge base
when they&rsquo;re merged again, because there is now a new
common ancestor. Git doesn&rsquo;t have to consider changes
that occurred before the merge base, so you don&rsquo;t have
to re-resolve any conflicts you resolved before.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
you perform a squash merge, a merge commit isn&rsquo;t
created; instead, the changes from one side are applied as a
regular commit to the other side. This means that the merge
base for these branches won&rsquo;t have changed, and so
when Git goes to perform its next merge, it considers all of
the changes that it considered the last time plus the new
changes. That means any conflicts may need to be
re-resolved. Similarly, anything using the <b>...</b>
notation in <b>git diff</b>, <b>git log</b>, or a GUI will
result in showing all of the changes since the original
merge base.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">As
a consequence, if you want to merge two long-lived branches
repeatedly, it&rsquo;s best to always use a regular merge
commit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
I make a change on two branches but revert it on one, why
does the merge of those branches include the
change?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">By
default, when Git does a merge, it uses a strategy called
the <b>ort</b> strategy, which does a fancy three-way merge.
In such a case, when Git performs the merge, it considers
exactly three points: the two heads and a third point,
called the <i>merge base</i>, which is usually the common
ancestor of those commits. Git does not consider the history
or the individual commits that have happened on those
branches at all.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">As
a result, if both sides have a change and one side has
reverted that change, the result is to include the change.
This is because the code has changed on one side and there
is no net change on the other, and in this scenario, Git
adopts the change.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
this is a problem for you, you can do a rebase instead,
rebasing the branch with the revert onto the other branch. A
rebase in this scenario will revert the change, because a
rebase applies each individual commit, including the revert.
Note that rebases rewrite history, so you should avoid
rebasing published branches unless you&rsquo;re sure
you&rsquo;re comfortable with that. See the NOTES section in
<a href="https://man.page/1/git-rebase">git-rebase(1)</a> for more details.</font></p>

<h2>HOOKS
<a name="HOOKS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">How
do I use hooks to prevent users from making certain
changes?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The only
safe place to make these changes is on the remote repository
(i.e., the Git server), usually in the <b>pre-receive</b>
hook or in a continuous integration (CI) system. These are
the locations in which policy can be enforced
effectively.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">It&rsquo;s
common to try to use <b>pre-commit</b> hooks (or, for commit
messages, <b>commit-msg</b> hooks) to check these things,
which is great if you&rsquo;re working as a solo developer
and want the tooling to help you. However, using hooks on a
developer machine is not effective as a policy control
because a user can bypass these hooks with
<b>--no-verify</b> without being noticed (among various
other ways). Git assumes that the user is in control of
their local repositories and doesn&rsquo;t try to prevent
this or tattle on the user.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
addition, some advanced users find <b>pre-commit</b> hooks
to be an impediment to workflows that use temporary commits
to stage work in progress or that create fixup commits, so
it&rsquo;s better to push these kinds of checks to the
server anyway.</font></p>

<h2>CROSS-PLATFORM ISSUES
<a name="CROSS-PLATFORM ISSUES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">I&rsquo;m
on Windows and my text files are detected as
binary.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Git works
best when you store text files as UTF-8. Many programs on
Windows support UTF-8, but some do not and only use the
little-endian UTF-16 format, which Git detects as binary. If
you can&rsquo;t use UTF-8 with your programs, you can
specify a working tree encoding that indicates which
encoding your files should be checked out with, while still
storing these files as UTF-8 in the repository. This allows
tools like <a href="https://man.page/1/git-diff">git-diff(1)</a> to work as expected, while
still allowing your tools to work.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
do so, you can specify a <a href="https://man.page/5/gitattributes">gitattributes(5)</a> pattern
with the <b>working-tree-encoding</b> attribute. For
example, the following pattern sets all C files to use
UTF-16LE-BOM, which is a common encoding on
Windows:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">*.c
working-tree-encoding=UTF-16LE-BOM</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">You
will need to run <b>git add --renormalize</b> to have this
take effect. Note that if you are making these changes on a
project that is used across platforms, you&rsquo;ll probably
want to make it in a per-user configuration file or in the
one in <b>$GIT_DIR/info/attributes</b>, since making it in a
<b>.gitattributes</b> file in the repository will apply to
all users of the repository.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">See
the following entry for information about normalizing line
endings as well, and see <a href="https://man.page/5/gitattributes">gitattributes(5)</a> for more
information about attribute files.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">I&rsquo;m
on Windows and git diff shows my files as having a <b>^M</b>
at the end.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">By
default, Git expects files to be stored with Unix line
endings. As such, the carriage return (<b>^M</b>) that is
part of a Windows line ending is shown because it is
considered to be trailing whitespace. Git defaults to
showing trailing whitespace only on new lines, not existing
ones.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">You
can store the files in the repository with Unix line endings
and convert them automatically to your platform&rsquo;s line
endings. To do that, set the configuration option
<b>core.eol</b> to <b>native</b> and see the following entry
for information about how to configure files as text or
binary.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">You
can also control this behavior with the
<b>core.whitespace</b> setting if you don&rsquo;t wish to
remove the carriage returns from your line
endings.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Why
do I have a file that&rsquo;s always modified?</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Internally,
Git always stores file names as sequences of bytes and
doesn&rsquo;t perform any encoding or case folding. However,
Windows and macOS by default both perform case folding on
file names. As a result, it&rsquo;s possible to end up with
multiple files or directories whose names differ only in
case. Git can handle this just fine, but the file system can
store only one of these files, so when Git reads the other
file to see its contents, it looks modified.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">It&rsquo;s
best to remove one of the files such that you only have one
file. You can do this with commands like the following
(assuming two files <b>AFile.txt</b> and <b>afile.txt</b>)
on an otherwise clean working tree:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">$
git rm --cached AFile.txt <br>
$ git commit -m 'Remove files conflicting in case' <br>
$ git checkout .</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
avoids touching the disk, but removes the additional file.
Your project may prefer to adopt a naming convention, such
as all-lowercase names, to avoid this problem from occurring
again; such a convention can be checked using a
<b>pre-receive</b> hook or as part of a continuous
integration (CI) system.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">It
is also possible for perpetually modified files to occur on
any platform if a smudge or clean filter is in use on your
system but a file was previously committed without running
the smudge or clean filter. To fix this, run the following
on an otherwise clean working tree:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">$
git add --renormalize .</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">What&rsquo;s
the recommended way to store files in Git?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">While Git
can store and handle any file of any type, there are some
settings that work better than others. In general, we
recommend that text files be stored in UTF-8 without a
byte-order mark (BOM) with LF (Unix-style) endings. We also
recommend the use of UTF-8 (again, without BOM) in commit
messages. These are the settings that work best across
platforms and with tools such as <b>git diff</b> and <b>git
merge</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Additionally,
if you have a choice between storage formats that are text
based or non-text based, we recommend storing files in the
text format and, if necessary, transforming them into the
other format. For example, a text-based SQL dump with one
record per line will work much better for diffing and
merging than an actual database file. Similarly, text-based
formats such as Markdown and AsciiDoc will work better than
binary formats such as Microsoft Word and PDF.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Similarly,
storing binary dependencies (e.g., shared libraries or JAR
files) or build products in the repository is generally not
recommended. Dependencies and build products are best stored
on an artifact or package server with only references, URLs,
and hashes stored in the repository.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">We
also recommend setting a <a href="https://man.page/5/gitattributes">gitattributes(5)</a> file to
explicitly mark which files are text and which are binary.
If you want Git to guess, you can set the attribute
<b>text=auto</b>. For example, the following might be
appropriate in some projects:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">#
By default, guess. <br>
* text=auto <br>
# Mark all C files as text. <br>
*.c text <br>
# Mark all JPEG files as binary. <br>
*.jpg binary</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">These
settings help tools pick the right format for output such as
patches and result in files being checked out in the
appropriate line ending for the platform.</font></p>
