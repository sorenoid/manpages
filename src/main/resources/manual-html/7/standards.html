various standards to which the documented interface
conforms. The following list briefly describes these
standards.</p>

release of the <i>Berkeley Software Distribution</i>,
released by the University of California at Berkeley. This
was the first Berkeley release that contained a TCP/IP stack
and the sockets API. 4.2BSD was released in 1983.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is an implementation
standard defined by AT&amp;T&rsquo;s milestone 1983 release
of its commercial System V (five) release. The previous
major AT&amp;T release was <i>System III</i>, released in
1981.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>System V release 2
(SVr2)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This was the next System V
release, made in 1985. The SVr2 was formally described in
the <i>System V Interface Definition version 1</i> (<i>SVID
1</i>) published in 1985.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>System V release 3
(SVr3)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This was the successor to SVr2,
released in 1986. This release was formally described in the
<i>System V Interface Definition version 2</i> (<i>SVID
2</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>System V release 4
(SVr4)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This was the successor to SVr3,

the &quot;Programmer&rsquo;s Reference Manual: Operating
System API (Intel processors)&quot; (Prentice-Hall 1992,
ISBN 0-13-951294-2) This release was formally described in
the <i>System V Interface Definition version 3</i> (<i>SVID

<p>This was the first C language standard, ratified by ANSI
(American National Standards Institute) in 1989
(<i>X3.159-1989</i>). Sometimes this is known as <i>ANSI
C</i>, but since C99 is also an ANSI standard, this term is
ambiguous. This standard was also ratified by ISO
(International Standards Organization) in 1990 (<i>ISO/IEC
9899:1990</i>), and is thus occasionally referred to as
<i>ISO C90</i>.</p></td></tr>

<p>Single UNIX Specification version 2. Sometimes also
referred to (incorrectly) as <i>XPG5</i>. This standard
appeared in 1997. Systems conforming to this standard can be
branded <i>UNIX 98</i>. See also
<a href="http://www.unix.org/version2/">http://www.unix.org/version2/</a>.)</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>POSIX.1-2001, SUSv3</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This was a 2001 revision and
consolidation of the POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and SUS standards
into a single document, conducted under the auspices of the
Austin Group
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">http://www.opengroup.org/austin/</a>.
The standard is available online at
<a href="http://www.unix.org/version3/">http://www.unix.org/version3/</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
defines two levels of conformance: <i>POSIX conformance</i>,
which is a baseline set of interfaces required of a
conforming system; and <i>XSI Conformance</i>, which
additionally mandates a set of interfaces (the &quot;XSI
extension&quot;) which are only optional for POSIX
conformance. XSI-conformant systems can be branded <i>UNIX
03</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>XBD</b>:
Definitions, terms and concepts, header file
specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>XSH</b>:
Specifications of functions (i.e., system calls and library
functions in actual implementations).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>XCU</b>:
Specifications of commands and utilities (i.e., the area
formerly described by POSIX.2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>XRAT</b>:
Informative text on the other parts of the standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">POSIX.1-2001 is
aligned with C99, so that all of the library functions
standardized in C99 are also standardized in
POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The Single UNIX
Specification version 3 (SUSv3) comprises the Base
Specifications containing XBD, XSH, XCU, and XRAT as above,
plus X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2 as an extra volume that
is not in POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Two Technical
Corrigenda (minor fixes and improvements) of the original
2001 standard have occurred: TC1 in 2003 and TC2 in
2004.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>POSIX.1-2008, SUSv4</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Work on the next revision of
POSIX.1/SUS was completed and ratified in 2008. The standard
is available online at
<a href="http://www.unix.org/version4/">http://www.unix.org/version4/</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The changes in
this revision are not as large as those that occurred for
POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a number of new interfaces are added
and various details of existing specifications are modified.
Many of the interfaces that were optional in POSIX.1-2001
become mandatory in the 2008 revision of the standard. A few
interfaces that are present in POSIX.1-2001 are marked as
obsolete in POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard
altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The revised
standard is structured in the same way as its predecessor.
The Single UNIX Specification version 4 (SUSv4) comprises
the Base Specifications containing XBD, XSH, XCU, and XRAT,
plus X/Open Curses Issue 7 as an extra volume that is not in
POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Again there are
two levels of conformance: the baseline <i>POSIX
Conformance</i>, and <i>XSI Conformance</i>, which mandates
an additional set of interfaces beyond those in the base
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
where the CONFORMING TO section of a manual page lists
POSIX.1-2001, it can be assumed that the interface also
conforms to POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Technical
Corrigendum 1 (minor fixes and improvements) of this
standard was released in 2013.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Technical
Corrigendum 2 of this standard was released in 2016.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Further
information can be found on the Austin Group web site,
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">http://www.opengroup.org/austin/</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SUSv4 2016 edition</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is equivalent to
POSIX.1-2008, with the addition of Technical Corrigenda 1
and 2 and the XCurses specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>POSIX.1-2017</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This revision of POSIX is
technically identical to POSIX.1-2008 with Technical
Corrigenda 1 and 2 applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SUSv4 2018 edition</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is equivalent to
POSIX.1-2017, with the addition of the XCurses
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The interfaces
documented in POSIX.1/SUS are available as manual pages
under sections 0p (header files), 1p (commands), and 3p
(functions); thus one can write &quot;man 3p open&quot;.</p>
