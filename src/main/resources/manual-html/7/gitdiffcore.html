<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gitdiffcore -
Tweaking diff output</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git diff</i>
*</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The diff
commands <i>git diff-index</i>, <i>git diff-files</i>, and
<i>git diff-tree</i> can be told to manipulate differences
they find in unconventional ways before showing <i>diff</i>
output. The manipulation is collectively called
&quot;diffcore transformation&quot;. This short note
describes what they are and how to use them to produce
<i>diff</i> output that is easier to understand than the
conventional kind.</p>

<h2>THE CHAIN OF OPERATION
<a name="THE CHAIN OF OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>git
diff-*</i> family works by first comparing two sets of
files:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>git
diff-index</i> compares contents of a &quot;tree&quot;
object and the working directory (when <b>--cached</b> flag
is not used) or a &quot;tree&quot; object and the index file
(when <b>--cached</b> flag is used);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>git
diff-files</i> compares contents of the index file and the
working directory;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>git
diff-tree</i> compares contents of two &quot;tree&quot;
objects;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In all of these
cases, the commands themselves first optionally limit the
two sets of files by any pathspecs given on their
command-lines, and compare corresponding paths in the two
resulting sets of files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pathspecs
are used to limit the world diff operates in. They remove
the filepairs outside the specified sets of pathnames. E.g.
If the input set of filepairs included:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644
bcd1234... 0123456... M junkfile</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but the command
invocation was <b>git diff-files myfile</b>, then the
junkfile entry would be removed from the list because only
&quot;myfile&quot; is under consideration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The result of
comparison is passed from these commands to what is
internally called &quot;diffcore&quot;, in a format similar
to what is output when the -p option is not used. E.g.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">in-place edit
:100644 100644 bcd1234... 0123456... M file0 <br>
create :000000 100644 0000000... 1234567... A file4 <br>
delete :100644 000000 1234567... 0000000... D file5 <br>
unmerged :000000 000000 0000000... 0000000... U file6</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The diffcore
mechanism is fed a list of such comparison results (each of
which is called &quot;filepair&quot;, although at this point
each of them talks about a single file), and transforms such
a list into another list. There are currently 5 such
transformations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore-break</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore-rename</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore-merge-broken</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore-pickaxe</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore-order</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore-rotate</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are
applied in sequence. The set of filepairs <i>git diff-*</i>
commands find are used as the input to diffcore-break, and
the output from diffcore-break is used as the input to the
next transformation. The final result is then passed to the
output routine and generates either diff-raw format (see
Output format sections of the manual for <i>git diff-*</i>
commands) or diff-patch format.</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-BREAK: FOR SPLITTING UP COMPLETE REWRITES
<a name="DIFFCORE-BREAK: FOR SPLITTING UP COMPLETE REWRITES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
transformation in the chain is diffcore-break, and is
controlled by the -B option to the <i>git diff-*</i>
commands. This is used to detect a filepair that represents
&quot;complete rewrite&quot; and break such filepair into
two filepairs that represent delete and create. E.g. If the
input contained this filepair:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644
bcd1234... 0123456... M file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and if it
detects that the file &quot;file0&quot; is completely
rewritten, it changes it to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 000000
bcd1234... 0000000... D file0 <br>
:000000 100644 0000000... 0123456... A file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the purpose
of breaking a filepair, diffcore-break examines the extent
of changes between the contents of the files before and
after modification (i.e. the contents that have
&quot;bcd1234...&quot; and &quot;0123456...&quot; as their
SHA-1 content ID, in the above example). The amount of
deletion of original contents and insertion of new material
are added together, and if it exceeds the &quot;break
score&quot;, the filepair is broken into two. The break
score defaults to 50% of the size of the smaller of the
original and the result (i.e. if the edit shrinks the file,
the size of the result is used; if the edit lengthens the
file, the size of the original is used), and can be
customized by giving a number after &quot;-B&quot; option
(e.g. &quot;-B75&quot; to tell it to use 75%).</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-RENAME: FOR DETECTING RENAMES AND COPIES
<a name="DIFFCORE-RENAME: FOR DETECTING RENAMES AND COPIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
transformation is used to detect renames and copies, and is
controlled by the -M option (to detect renames) and the -C
option (to detect copies as well) to the <i>git diff-*</i>
commands. If the input contained these filepairs:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 000000
0123456... 0000000... D fileX <br>
:000000 100644 0000000... 0123456... A file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and the
contents of the deleted file fileX is similar enough to the
contents of the created file file0, then rename detection
merges these filepairs and creates:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644
0123456... 0123456... R100 fileX file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
&quot;-C&quot; option is used, the original contents of
modified files, and deleted files (and also unmodified
files, if the &quot;--find-copies-harder&quot; option is
used) are considered as candidates of the source files in
rename/copy operation. If the input were like these
filepairs, that talk about a modified file fileY and a newly
created file file0:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644
0123456... 1234567... M fileY <br>
:000000 100644 0000000... bcd3456... A file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the original
contents of fileY and the resulting contents of file0 are
compared, and if they are similar enough, they are changed
to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644
0123456... 1234567... M fileY <br>
:100644 100644 0123456... bcd3456... C100 fileY file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In both rename
and copy detection, the same &quot;extent of changes&quot;
algorithm used in diffcore-break is used to determine if two
files are &quot;similar enough&quot;, and can be customized
to use a similarity score different from the default of 50%
by giving a number after the &quot;-M&quot; or
&quot;-C&quot; option (e.g. &quot;-M8&quot; to tell it to
use 8/10 = 80%).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
rename detection is on but both copy and break detection are
off, rename detection adds a preliminary step that first
checks if files are moved across directories while keeping
their filename the same. If there is a file added to a
directory whose contents is sufficiently similar to a file
with the same name that got deleted from a different
directory, it will mark them as renames and exclude them
from the later quadratic step (the one that pairwise
compares all unmatched files to find the &quot;best&quot;
matches, determined by the highest content similarity). So,
for example, if a deleted docs/ext.txt and an added
docs/config/ext.txt are similar enough, they will be marked
as a rename and prevent an added docs/ext.md that may be
even more similar to the deleted docs/ext.txt from being
considered as the rename destination in the later step. For
this reason, the preliminary &quot;match same filename&quot;
step uses a bit higher threshold to mark a file pair as a
rename and stop considering other candidates for better
matches. At most, one comparison is done per file in this
preliminary pass; so if there are several remaining ext.txt
files throughout the directory hierarchy after exact rename
detection, this preliminary step may be skipped for those
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note. When the
&quot;-C&quot; option is used with
<b>--find-copies-harder</b> option, <i>git diff-*</i>
commands feed unmodified filepairs to diffcore mechanism as
well as modified ones. This lets the copy detector consider
unmodified files as copy source candidates at the expense of
making it slower. Without <b>--find-copies-harder</b>,
<i>git diff-*</i> commands can detect copies only if the
file that was copied happened to have been modified in the
same changeset.</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-MERGE-BROKEN: FOR PUTTING COMPLETE REWRITES BACK TOGETHER
<a name="DIFFCORE-MERGE-BROKEN: FOR PUTTING COMPLETE REWRITES BACK TOGETHER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
transformation is used to merge filepairs broken by
diffcore-break, and not transformed into rename/copy by
diffcore-rename, back into a single modification. This
always runs when diffcore-break is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the purpose
of merging broken filepairs back, it uses a different
&quot;extent of changes&quot; computation from the ones used
by diffcore-break and diffcore-rename. It counts only the
deletion from the original, and does not count insertion. If
you removed only 10 lines from a 100-line document, even if
you added 910 new lines to make a new 1000-line document,
you did not do a complete rewrite. diffcore-break breaks
such a case in order to help diffcore-rename to consider
such filepairs as candidate of rename/copy detection, but if
filepairs broken that way were not matched with other
filepairs to create rename/copy, then this transformation
merges them back into the original
&quot;modification&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;extent of changes&quot; parameter can be tweaked from
the default 80% (that is, unless more than 80% of the
original material is deleted, the broken pairs are merged
back into a single modification) by giving a second number
to -B option, like these:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; -B50/60
(give 50% &quot;break score&quot; to diffcore-break, use 60%
for diffcore-merge-broken).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; -B/60
(the same as above, since diffcore-break defaults to
50%).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
earlier implementation left a broken pair as a separate
creation and deletion patches. This was an unnecessary hack
and the latest implementation always merges all the broken
pairs back into modifications, but the resulting patch
output is formatted differently for easier review in case of
such a complete rewrite by showing the entire contents of
old version prefixed with <i>-</i>, followed by the entire
contents of new version prefixed with <i>+</i>.</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-PICKAXE: FOR DETECTING ADDITION/DELETION OF SPECIFIED STRING
<a name="DIFFCORE-PICKAXE: FOR DETECTING ADDITION/DELETION OF SPECIFIED STRING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
transformation limits the set of filepairs to those that
change specified strings between the preimage and the
postimage in a certain way. -S&lt;block of text&gt; and
-G&lt;regular expression&gt; options are used to specify
different ways these strings are sought.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;-S&lt;block
of text&gt;&quot; detects filepairs whose preimage and
postimage have different number of occurrences of the
specified block of text. By definition, it will not detect
in-file moves. Also, when a changeset moves a file wholesale
without affecting the interesting string, diffcore-rename
kicks in as usual, and <b>-S</b> omits the filepair (since
the number of occurrences of that string didn&rsquo;t change
in that rename-detected filepair). When used with
<b>--pickaxe-regex</b>, treat the &lt;block of text&gt; as
an extended POSIX regular expression to match, instead of a
literal string.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;-G&lt;regular
expression&gt;&quot; (mnemonic: grep) detects filepairs
whose textual diff has an added or a deleted line that
matches the given regular expression. This means that it
will detect in-file (or what rename-detection considers the
same file) moves, which is noise. The implementation runs
diff twice and greps, and this can be quite expensive. To
speed things up binary files without textconv filters will
be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When <b>-S</b>
or <b>-G</b> are used without <b>--pickaxe-all</b>, only
filepairs that match their respective criterion are kept in
the output. When <b>--pickaxe-all</b> is used, if even one
filepair matches their respective criterion in a changeset,
the entire changeset is kept. This behavior is designed to
make reviewing changes in the context of the whole changeset
easier.</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-ORDER: FOR SORTING THE OUTPUT BASED ON FILENAMES
<a name="DIFFCORE-ORDER: FOR SORTING THE OUTPUT BASED ON FILENAMES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is used to
reorder the filepairs according to the user&rsquo;s (or
project&rsquo;s) taste, and is controlled by the -O option
to the <i>git diff-*</i> commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This takes a
text file each of whose lines is a shell glob pattern.
Filepairs that match a glob pattern on an earlier line in
the file are output before ones that match a later line, and
filepairs that do not match any glob pattern are output
last.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an example,
a typical orderfile for the core Git probably would look
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">README <br>
Makefile <br>
Documentation <br>
*.h <br>
*.c <br>
t</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-ROTATE: FOR CHANGING AT WHICH PATH OUTPUT STARTS
<a name="DIFFCORE-ROTATE: FOR CHANGING AT WHICH PATH OUTPUT STARTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
transformation takes one pathname, and rotates the set of
filepairs so that the filepair for the given pathname comes
first, optionally discarding the paths that come before it.
This is used to implement the <b>--skip-to</b> and the
<b>--rotate-to</b> options. It is an error when the
specified pathname is not in the set of filepairs, but it is
not useful to error out when used with &quot;git log&quot;
family of commands, because it is unreasonable to expect
that a given path would be modified by each and every commit
shown by the &quot;git log&quot; command. For this reason,
when used with &quot;git log&quot;, the filepair that sorts
the same as, or the first one that sorts after, the given
pathname is where the output starts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use of this
transformation combined with diffcore-order will produce
unexpected results, as the input to this transformation is
likely not sorted when diffcore-order is in effect.</p>
