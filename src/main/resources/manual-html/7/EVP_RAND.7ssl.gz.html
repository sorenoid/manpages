</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#include

#include &lt;rand.h&gt;</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
OpenSSL <small>RAND</small> method is based on the
<small>EVP_RAND</small> classes to provide non-deterministic
inputs to other cryptographic algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While the
<small>RAND API</small> is the &rsquo;frontend&rsquo; which
is intended to be used by application developers for
obtaining random bytes, the <small>EVP_RAND API</small>
serves as the &rsquo;backend&rsquo;, connecting the former
with the operating systems&rsquo;s entropy sources and
providing access to deterministic random bit generators (
<small>DRBG</small> ) and their configuration parameters. A
<small>DRBG</small> is a certain type of
cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator (
<small>CSPRNG</small> ), which is described in [ <small>NIST
SP 800-90A</small> Rev. 1].</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Disclaimer</b>
<br>
Unless you have very specific requirements for your random
generator, it is in general not necessary to utilize the
<small>EVP_RAND API</small> directly. The usual way to
obtain random bytes is to use <a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_bytes">RAND_bytes(3)</a> or
<a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_priv_bytes">RAND_priv_bytes(3)</a>, see also
<b><small>RAND</small></b> (7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Typical Use
Cases</b> <br>
Typical examples for such special use cases are the
following:</p>

<p>You want to use your own private <small>DRBG</small>
instances. Multiple <small>DRBG</small> instances which are
accessed only by a single thread provide additional security
(because their internal states are independent) and better
scalability in multithreaded applications (because they
don&rsquo;t need to be locked).</p></td></tr>

<h2>EVP_RAND CHAINING
<a name="EVP_RAND CHAINING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
<small>EVP_RAND</small> instance can be used as the entropy
source of another <small>EVP_RAND</small> instance, provided
it has itself access to a valid entropy source. The
<small>EVP_RAND</small> instance which acts as entropy
source is called the <i>parent</i>, the other instance the
<i>child</i>. Typically, the child will be a
<small>DRBG</small> because it does not make sense for the
child to be an entropy source.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is called
chaining. A chained <small>EVP_RAND</small> instance is
created by passing a pointer to the parent
<small>EVP_RAND_CTX</small> as argument to the
<b>EVP_RAND_CTX_new()</b> call. It is possible to create
chains of more than two <small>DRBG</small> in a row. It is
also possible to use any <small>EVP_RAND_CTX</small> class
as the parent, however, only a live entropy source may
ignore and not use its parent.</p>

<h2>THE THREE SHARED DRBG INSTANCES
<a name="THE THREE SHARED DRBG INSTANCES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently,
there are three shared <small>DRBG</small> instances, the
&lt;primary&gt;, &lt;public&gt;, and &lt;private&gt;
<small>DRBG.</small> While the &lt;primary&gt;
<small>DRBG</small> is a single global instance, the
&lt;public&gt; and &lt;private&gt; <small>DRBG</small> are
created per thread and accessed through thread-local
storage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
functions <a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_bytes">RAND_bytes(3)</a> and <a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_priv_bytes">RAND_priv_bytes(3)</a>
use the thread-local &lt;public&gt; and &lt;private&gt;
<small>DRBG</small> instance, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
&lt;primary&gt; <small>DRBG</small> instance</b> <br>
The &lt;primary&gt; <small>DRBG</small> is not used directly
by the application, only for reseeding the two other two
<small>DRBG</small> instances. It reseeds itself by
obtaining randomness either from os entropy sources or by
consuming randomness which was added previously by
<a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_add">RAND_add(3)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
&lt;public&gt; <small>DRBG</small> instance</b> <br>
This instance is used per default by
<a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_bytes">RAND_bytes(3)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
&lt;private&gt; <small>DRBG</small> instance</b> <br>
This instance is used per default by
<a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_priv_bytes">RAND_priv_bytes(3)</a></p>

<h2>LOCKING
<a name="LOCKING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;primary&gt; <small>DRBG</small> is intended to be
accessed concurrently for reseeding by its child
<small>DRBG</small> instances. The necessary locking is done
internally. It is <i>not</i> thread-safe to access the
&lt;primary&gt; <small>DRBG</small> directly via the
<small>EVP_RAND</small> interface. The &lt;public&gt; and
&lt;private&gt; <small>DRBG</small> are thread-local, i.e.
there is an instance of each per thread. So they can safely
be accessed without locking via the <small>EVP_RAND</small>
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pointers to
these <small>DRBG</small> instances can be obtained using
<b>RAND_get0_primary()</b>, <b>RAND_get0_public()</b> and
<b>RAND_get0_private()</b>, respectively. Note that it is
not allowed to store a pointer to one of the thread-local
<small>DRBG</small> instances in a variable or other memory
location where it will be accessed and used by multiple
threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All other
<small>DRBG</small> instances created by an application
don&rsquo;t support locking, because they are intended to be
used by a single thread. Instead of accessing a single
<small>DRBG</small> instance concurrently from different
threads, it is recommended to instantiate a separate
<small>DRBG</small> instance per thread. Using the
&lt;primary&gt; <small>DRBG</small> as entropy source for
multiple <small>DRBG</small> instances on different threads
is thread-safe, because the <small>DRBG</small> instance
will lock the &lt;primary&gt; <small>DRBG</small>
automatically for obtaining random input.</p>

<h2>THE OVERALL PICTURE
<a name="THE OVERALL PICTURE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
picture gives an overview over how the <small>DRBG</small>
instances work together and are being used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The usual way
to obtain random bytes is to call RAND_bytes(...) or
RAND_priv_bytes(...). These calls are roughly equivalent to
calling EVP_RAND_generate(&lt;public&gt;, ...) and
EVP_RAND_generate(&lt;private&gt;, ...), respectively.</p>

<h2>RESEEDING
<a name="RESEEDING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<small>DRBG</small> instance seeds itself automatically,
pulling random input from its entropy source. The entropy
source can be either a trusted operating system entropy
source, or another <small>DRBG</small> with access to such a
source.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Automatic
reseeding occurs after a predefined number of generate
requests. The selection of the trusted entropy sources is
configured at build time using the --with-rand-seed option.
The following sections explain the reseeding process in more
detail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Automatic
Reseeding</b> <br>
Before satisfying a generate request
(<a href="https://man.page/3/EVP_RAND_generate">EVP_RAND_generate(3)</a>), the <small>DRBG</small>
reseeds itself automatically, if one of the following
conditions holds:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- the
<small>DRBG</small> was not instantiated (=seeded) yet or
has been uninstantiated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- the number of
generate requests since the last reseeding exceeds a certain
threshold, the so called <i>reseed_interval</i>. This
behaviour can be disabled by setting the
<i>reseed_interval</i> to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- the time
elapsed since the last reseeding exceeds a certain time
interval, the so called <i>reseed_time_interval</i>. This
can be disabled by setting the <i>reseed_time_interval</i>
to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- the
<small>DRBG</small> is in an error state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note</b>: An
error state is entered if the entropy source fails while the
<small>DRBG</small> is seeding or reseeding. The last case
ensures that the <small>DRBG</small> automatically recovers
from the error as soon as the entropy source is available
again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Manual
Reseeding</b> <br>
In addition to automatic reseeding, the caller can request
an immediate reseeding of the <small>DRBG</small> with fresh
entropy by setting the <i>prediction resistance</i>
parameter to 1 when calling <a href="https://man.page/3/EVP_RAND_generate">EVP_RAND_generate(3)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The document [
<small>NIST SP 800-90C</small> ] describes prediction
resistance requests in detail and imposes strict conditions
on the entropy sources that are approved for providing
prediction resistance. A request for prediction resistance
can only be satisfied by pulling fresh entropy from a live
entropy source (section 5.5.2 of [ <small>NIST SP
800-90C</small> ]). It is up to the user to ensure that a
live entropy source is configured and is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the three
shared DRBGs (and only for these) there is another way to
reseed them manually: If <a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_add">RAND_add(3)</a> is called with a
positive <i>randomness</i> argument (or
<a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_seed">RAND_seed(3)</a>), then this will immediately reseed the
&lt;primary&gt; <small>DRBG.</small> The &lt;public&gt; and
&lt;private&gt; <small>DRBG</small> will detect this on
their next generate call and reseed, pulling randomness from
&lt;primary&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last
feature has been added to support the common practice used
with previous OpenSSL versions to call <b>RAND_add()</b>
before calling <b>RAND_bytes()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Entropy
Input and Additional Data</b> <br>
The <small>DRBG</small> distinguishes two different types of
random input: <i>entropy</i>, which comes from a trusted
source, and <i>additional input</i>&rsquo;, which can
optionally be added by the user and is considered untrusted.
It is possible to add <i>additional input</i> not only
during reseeding, but also for every generate request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Configuring
the Random Seed Source</b> <br>
In most cases OpenSSL will automatically choose a suitable
seed source for automatically seeding and reseeding its
&lt;primary&gt; <small>DRBG.</small> In some cases however,
it will be necessary to explicitly specify a seed source
during configuration, using the --with-rand-seed option. For
more information, see the <small>INSTALL</small>
instructions. There are also operating systems where no seed
source is available and automatic reseeding is disabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
two sections describe the reseeding process of the primary
<small>DRBG,</small> depending on whether automatic
reseeding is available or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Reseeding
the primary <small>DRBG</small> with automatic seeding
enabled</b> <br>
Calling <b>RAND_poll()</b> or <b>RAND_add()</b> is not
necessary, because the <small>DRBG</small> pulls the
necessary entropy from its source automatically. However,
both calls are permitted, and do reseed the
<small>RNG.</small></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>RAND_add()</b>
can be used to add both kinds of random input, depending on
the value of the <i>randomness</i> argument: <br>
randomness == 0:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The random bytes are mixed as
additional input into the current state of the
<small>DRBG.</small> Mixing in additional input is not
considered a full reseeding, hence the reseed counter is not
reset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">randomness &gt; 0:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The random bytes are used as
entropy input for a full reseeding (resp. reinstantiation)
if the <small>DRBG</small> is instantiated (resp.
uninstantiated or in an error state). The number of random
bits required for reseeding is determined by the security
strength of the <small>DRBG.</small> Currently it defaults
to 256 bits (32 bytes). It is possible to provide less
randomness than required. In this case the missing
randomness will be obtained by pulling random input from the
trusted entropy sources.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>NOTE:</small>
Manual reseeding is *not allowed* in <small>FIPS</small>
mode, because [ <small>NIST</small> SP-800-90Ar1] mandates
that entropy *shall not* be provided by the consuming
application for instantiation (Section 9.1) or reseeding
(Section 9.2). For that reason, the <i>randomness</i>
argument is ignored and the random bytes provided by the
<a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_add">RAND_add(3)</a> and <a href="https://man.page/3/RAND_seed">RAND_seed(3)</a> calls are treated
as additional data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Reseeding
the primary <small>DRBG</small> with automatic seeding
disabled</b> <br>
Calling <b>RAND_poll()</b> will always fail.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>RAND_add()</b>
needs to be called for initial seeding and periodic
reseeding. At least 48 bytes (384 bits) of randomness have
to be provided, otherwise the (re-)seeding of the
<small>DRBG</small> will fail. This corresponds to one and a
half times the security strength of the <small>DRBG.</small>
The extra half is used for the nonce during
instantiation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More precisely,
the number of bytes needed for seeding depend on the
<i>security strength</i> of the <small>DRBG,</small> which
is set to 256 by default.</p>
