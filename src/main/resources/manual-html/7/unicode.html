<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">unicode -
universal character set</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
international standard ISO 10646 defines the Universal
Character Set (UCS). UCS contains all characters of all
other character set standards. It also guarantees
&quot;round-trip compatibility&quot;; in other words,
conversion tables can be built such that no information is
lost when a string is converted from any other encoding to
UCS and back.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">UCS contains
the characters required to represent practically all known
languages. This includes not only the Latin, Greek,
Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Armenian, and Georgian scripts,
but also Chinese, Japanese and Korean Han ideographs as well
as scripts such as Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, Devanagari,
Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada,
Malayalam, Thai, Lao, Khmer, Bopomofo, Tibetan, Runic,
Ethiopic, Canadian Syllabics, Cherokee, Mongolian, Ogham,
Myanmar, Sinhala, Thaana, Yi, and others. For scripts not
yet covered, research on how to best encode them for
computer usage is still going on and they will be added
eventually. This might eventually include not only
Hieroglyphs and various historic Indo-European languages,
but even some selected artistic scripts such as Tengwar,
Cirth, and Klingon. UCS also covers a large number of
graphical, typographical, mathematical, and scientific
symbols, including those provided by TeX, Postscript, APL,
MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Macintosh, OCR fonts, as well as many
word processing and publishing systems, and more are being
added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The UCS
standard (ISO 10646) describes a 31-bit character set
architecture consisting of 128 24-bit <i>groups</i>, each
divided into 256 16-bit <i>planes</i> made up of 256 8-bit
<i>rows</i> with 256 <i>column</i> positions, one for each
character. Part 1 of the standard (ISO 10646-1) defines the
first 65534 code positions (0x0000 to 0xfffd), which form
the <i>Basic Multilingual Plane</i> (BMP), that is plane 0
in group 0. Part 2 of the standard (ISO 10646-2) adds
characters to group 0 outside the BMP in several
<i>supplementary planes</i> in the range 0x10000 to
0x10ffff. There are no plans to add characters beyond
0x10ffff to the standard, therefore of the entire code
space, only a small fraction of group 0 will ever be
actually used in the foreseeable future. The BMP contains
all characters found in the commonly used other character
sets. The supplemental planes added by ISO 10646-2 cover
only more exotic characters for special scientific,
dictionary printing, publishing industry, higher-level
protocol and enthusiast needs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
representation of each UCS character as a 2-byte word is
referred to as the UCS-2 form (only for BMP characters),
whereas UCS-4 is the representation of each character by a
4-byte word. In addition, there exist two encoding forms
UTF-8 for backward compatibility with ASCII processing
software and UTF-16 for the backward-compatible handling of
non-BMP characters up to 0x10ffff by UCS-2 software.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The UCS
characters 0x0000 to 0x007f are identical to those of the
classic US-ASCII character set and the characters in the
range 0x0000 to 0x00ff are identical to those in ISO 8859-1
(Latin-1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Combining
characters</b> <br>
Some code points in UCS have been assigned to <i>combining
characters</i>. These are similar to the nonspacing accent
keys on a typewriter. A combining character just adds an
accent to the previous character. The most important
accented characters have codes of their own in UCS, however,
the combining character mechanism allows us to add accents
and other diacritical marks to any character. The combining
characters always follow the character which they modify.
For example, the German character Umlaut-A (&quot;Latin
capital letter A with diaeresis&quot;) can either be
represented by the precomposed UCS code 0x00c4, or
alternatively as the combination of a normal &quot;Latin
capital letter A&quot; followed by a &quot;combining
diaeresis&quot;: 0x0041 0x0308.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Combining
characters are essential for instance for encoding the Thai
script or for mathematical typesetting and users of the
International Phonetic Alphabet.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Implementation
levels</b> <br>
As not all systems are expected to support advanced
mechanisms like combining characters, ISO 10646-1 specifies
the following three <i>implementation levels</i> of UCS:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p>Level 1</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="75%">


<p>Combining characters and Hangul Jamo (a variant encoding
of the Korean script, where a Hangul syllable glyph is coded
as a triplet or pair of vowel/consonant codes) are not
supported.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p>Level 2</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="75%">


<p>In addition to level 1, combining characters are now
allowed for some languages where they are essential (e.g.,
Thai, Lao, Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari, Malayalam).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p>Level 3</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="75%">


<p>All UCS characters are supported.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Unicode 3.0
Standard published by the Unicode Consortium contains
exactly the UCS Basic Multilingual Plane at implementation
level 3, as described in ISO 10646-1:2000. Unicode 3.1 added
the supplemental planes of ISO 10646-2. The Unicode standard
and technical reports published by the Unicode Consortium
provide much additional information on the semantics and
recommended usages of various characters. They provide
guidelines and algorithms for editing, sorting, comparing,
normalizing, converting, and displaying Unicode strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unicode
under Linux</b> <br>
Under GNU/Linux, the C type <i>wchar_t</i> is a signed
32-bit integer type. Its values are always interpreted by
the C library as UCS code values (in all locales), a
convention that is signaled by the GNU C library to
applications by defining the constant
<b>__STDC_ISO_10646__</b> as specified in the ISO C99
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">UCS/Unicode can
be used just like ASCII in input/output streams, terminal
communication, plaintext files, filenames, and environment
variables in the ASCII compatible UTF-8 multibyte encoding.
To signal the use of UTF-8 as the character encoding to all
applications, a suitable <i>locale</i> has to be selected
via environment variables (e.g.,
&quot;LANG=en_GB.UTF-8&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>nl_langinfo(CODESET)</b> function returns the name of the
selected encoding. Library functions such as
<a href="https://man.page/3/wctomb">wctomb(3)</a> and <a href="https://man.page/3/mbsrtowcs">mbsrtowcs(3)</a> can be used to
transform the internal <i>wchar_t</i> characters and strings
into the system character encoding and back and
<a href="https://man.page/3/wcwidth">wcwidth(3)</a> tells, how many positions (0&ndash;2) the
cursor is advanced by the output of a character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Private Use
Areas (PUA)</b> <br>
In the Basic Multilingual Plane, the range 0xe000 to 0xf8ff
will never be assigned to any characters by the standard and
is reserved for private usage. For the Linux community, this
private area has been subdivided further into the range
0xe000 to 0xefff which can be used individually by any
end-user and the Linux zone in the range 0xf000 to 0xf8ff
where extensions are coordinated among all Linux users. The
registry of the characters assigned to the Linux zone is
maintained by LANANA and the registry itself is
<i>Documentation/admin-guide/unicode.rst</i> in the Linux
kernel sources (or <i>Documentation/unicode.txt</i> before
Linux 4.10).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two other
planes are reserved for private usage, plane 15
(Supplementary Private Use Area-A, range 0xf0000 to 0xffffd)
and plane 16 (Supplementary Private Use Area-B, range
0x100000 to 0x10fffd).</p>
