<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">libc - overview
of standard C libraries on Linux</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The term
&quot;libc&quot; is commonly used as a shorthand for the
&quot;standard C library&quot;, a library of standard
functions that can be used by all C programs (and sometimes
by programs in other languages). Because of some history
(see below), use of the term &quot;libc&quot; to refer to
the standard C library is somewhat ambiguous on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>glibc</b>
<br>
By far the most widely used C library on Linux is the GNU C
Library
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/</a>,
often referred to as <i>glibc</i>. This is the C library
that is nowadays used in all major Linux distributions. It
is also the C library whose details are documented in the
relevant pages of the <i>man-pages</i> project (primarily in
Section 3 of the manual). Documentation of glibc is also
available in the glibc manual, available via the command
<i>info libc</i>. Release 1.0 of glibc was made in September
1992. (There were earlier 0.x releases.) The next major
release of glibc was 2.0, at the beginning of 1997.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pathname
<i>/lib/libc.so.6</i> (or something similar) is normally a
symbolic link that points to the location of the glibc
library, and executing this pathname will cause glibc to
display various information about the version installed on
your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Linux
libc</b> <br>
In the early to mid 1990s, there was for a while <i>Linux
libc</i>, a fork of glibc 1.x created by Linux developers
who felt that glibc development at the time was not
sufficing for the needs of Linux. Often, this library was
referred to (ambiguously) as just &quot;libc&quot;. Linux
libc released major versions 2, 3, 4, and 5, as well as many
minor versions of those releases. Linux libc4 was the last
version to use the a.out binary format, and the first
version to provide (primitive) shared library support. Linux
libc 5 was the first version to support the ELF binary
format; this version used the shared library soname
<i>libc.so.5</i>. For a while, Linux libc was the standard C
library in many Linux distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However,
notwithstanding the original motivations of the Linux libc
effort, by the time glibc 2.0 was released (in 1997), it was
clearly superior to Linux libc, and all major Linux
distributions that had been using Linux libc soon switched
back to glibc. To avoid any confusion with Linux libc
versions, glibc 2.0 and later used the shared library soname
<i>libc.so.6</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since the
switch from Linux libc to glibc 2.0 occurred long ago,
<i>man-pages</i> no longer takes care to document Linux libc
details. Nevertheless, the history is visible in vestiges of
information about Linux libc that remain in a few manual
pages, in particular, references to <i>libc4</i> and
<i>libc5</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Other C
libraries</b> <br>
There are various other less widely used C libraries for
Linux. These libraries are generally smaller than glibc,
both in terms of features and memory footprint, and often
intended for building small binaries, perhaps targeted at
development for embedded Linux systems. Among such libraries
are <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/"><i>uClibc</i></a>,
<a href="http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/"><i>dietlibc</i></a>,
and <a href="http://www.musl-libc.org/"><i>musl
libc</i></a>. Details of these libraries are covered by the
<i>man-pages</i> project, where they are known.</p>
