POSIX safety concepts</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Note</i>:
the text of this man page is based on the material taken
from the &quot;POSIX Safety Concepts&quot; section of the
GNU C Library manual. Further details on the topics
described here can be found in that manual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various
function manual pages include a section ATTRIBUTES that
describes the safety of calling the function in various
contexts. This section annotates functions with the
following safety markings: <i><br>
MT-Safe</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>MT-Safe</i> or Thread-Safe
functions are safe to call in the presence of other threads.
MT, in MT-Safe, stands for Multi Thread.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Being MT-Safe
does not imply a function is atomic, nor that it uses any of
the memory synchronization mechanisms POSIX exposes to
users. It is even possible that calling MT-Safe functions in
sequence does not yield an MT-Safe combination. For example,
having a thread call two MT-Safe functions one right after
the other does not guarantee behavior equivalent to atomic
execution of a combination of both functions, since
concurrent calls in other threads may interfere in a
destructive way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Whole-program
optimizations that could inline functions across library
interfaces may expose unsafe reordering, and so performing
inlining across the GNU C Library interface is not
recommended. The documented MT-Safety status is not
guaranteed under whole-program optimization. However,
functions defined in user-visible headers are designed to be
safe for inlining.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>MT-Unsafe</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>MT-Unsafe</i> functions are
not safe to call in a multithreaded programs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other keywords
that appear in safety notes are defined in subsequent
sections.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Conditionally
safe features</b> <br>
For some features that make functions unsafe to call in
certain contexts, there are known ways to avoid the safety
problem other than refraining from calling the function
altogether. The keywords that follow refer to such features,
and each of their definitions indicates how the whole
program needs to be constrained in order to remove the
safety problem indicated by the keyword. Only when all the
reasons that make a function unsafe are observed and
addressed, by applying the documented constraints, does the
function become safe to call in a context.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><i>init</i></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Functions marked with <i>init</i> as an MT-Unsafe
feature perform MT-Unsafe initialization when they are first
called.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Calling such a
function at least once in single-threaded mode removes this
specific cause for the function to be regarded as MT-Unsafe.
If no other cause for that remains, the function can then be
safely called after other threads are started.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>race</i></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions annotated with
<i>race</i> as an MT-Safety issue operate on objects in ways
that may cause data races or similar forms of destructive
interference out of concurrent execution. In some cases, the
objects are passed to the functions by users; in others,
they are used by the functions to return values to users; in
others, they are not even exposed to users.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><i>const</i></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Functions marked with <i>const</i> as an MT-Safety issue
non-atomically modify internal objects that are better
regarded as constant, because a substantial portion of the
GNU C Library accesses them without synchronization. Unlike
<i>race</i>, which causes both readers and writers of
internal objects to be regarded as MT-Unsafe, this mark is
applied to writers only. Writers remain MT-Unsafe to call,
but the then-mandatory constness of objects they modify
enables readers to be regarded as MT-Safe (as long as no
other reasons for them to be unsafe remain), since the lack
of synchronization is not a problem when the objects are
effectively constant.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The identifier
that follows the <i>const</i> mark will appear by itself as
a safety note in readers. Programs that wish to work around
this safety issue, so as to call writers, may use a
non-recursive read-write lock associated with the
identifier, and guard <i>all</i> calls to functions marked
with <i>const</i> followed by the identifier with a write
lock, and <i>all</i> calls to functions marked with the
identifier by itself with a read lock.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>sig</i></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions marked with <i>sig</i>
as a MT-Safety issue may temporarily install a signal
handler for internal purposes, which may interfere with
other uses of the signal, identified after a colon.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This safety
problem can be worked around by ensuring that no other uses
of the signal will take place for the duration of the call.
Holding a non-recursive mutex while calling all functions
that use the same temporary signal; blocking that signal
before the call and resetting its handler afterwards is
recommended.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>term</i></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions marked with
<i>term</i> as an MT-Safety issue may change the terminal
settings in the recommended way, namely: call
<a href="https://man.page/3/tcgetattr">tcgetattr(3)</a>, modify some flags, and then call
<a href="https://man.page/3/tcsetattr">tcsetattr(3)</a>, this creates a window in which changes
made by other threads are lost. Thus, functions marked with
<i>term</i> are MT-Unsafe.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">It is thus
advisable for applications using the terminal to avoid
concurrent and reentrant interactions with it, by not using
it in signal handlers or blocking signals that might use it,
and holding a lock while calling these functions and
interacting with the terminal. This lock should also be used
for mutual exclusion with functions marked with
<i>race:tcattr(fd)</i>, where <i>fd</i> is a file descriptor
for the controlling terminal. The caller may use a single
mutex for simplicity, or use one mutex per terminal, even if
referenced by different file descriptors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Other safety
remarks</b> <br>
Additional keywords may be attached to functions, indicating
features that do not make a function unsafe to call, but
that may need to be taken into account in certain classes of
programs:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>locale</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions annotated with
<i>locale</i> as an MT-Safety issue read from the locale
object without any form of synchronization. Functions
annotated with <i>locale</i> called concurrently with locale
changes may behave in ways that do not correspond to any of
the locales active during their execution, but an
unpredictable mix thereof.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">We do not mark
these functions as MT-Unsafe, however, because functions
that modify the locale object are marked with
<i>const:locale</i> and regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe,
the latter are not to be called when multiple threads are
running or asynchronous signals are enabled, and so the
locale can be considered effectively constant in these
contexts, which makes the former safe.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>env</i></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions marked with <i>env</i>
as an MT-Safety issue access the environment with
<a href="https://man.page/3/getenv">getenv(3)</a> or similar, without any guards to ensure
safety in the presence of concurrent modifications.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">We do not mark
these functions as MT-Unsafe, however, because functions
that modify the environment are all marked with
<i>const:env</i> and regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe, the
latter are not to be called when multiple threads are
running or asynchronous signals are enabled, and so the
environment can be considered effectively constant in these
contexts, which makes the former safe.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>hostid</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function marked with
<i>hostid</i> as an MT-Safety issue reads from the
system-wide data structures that hold the &quot;host
ID&quot; of the machine. These data structures cannot
generally be modified atomically. Since it is expected that
the &quot;host ID&quot; will not normally change, the
function that reads from it (<a href="https://man.page/3/gethostid">gethostid(3)</a>) is
regarded as safe, whereas the function that modifies it
(<a href="https://man.page/3/sethostid">sethostid(3)</a>) is marked with <i>const:hostid</i>,
indicating it may require special care if it is to be
called. In this specific case, the special care amounts to
system-wide (not merely intra-process) coordination.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>sigintr</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Functions marked with
<i>sigintr</i> as an MT-Safety issue access the GNU C
Library <i>_sigintr</i> internal data structure without any
guards to ensure safety in the presence of concurrent
modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">We do not mark
these functions as MT-Unsafe, however, because functions
that modify this data structure are all marked with
<i>const:sigintr</i> and regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe,
the latter are not to be called when multiple threads are
running or asynchronous signals are enabled, and so the data
structure can be considered effectively constant in these
contexts, which makes the former safe.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><i>cwd</i></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Functions marked with <i>cwd</i> as an MT-Safety issue
may temporarily change the current working directory during
their execution, which may cause relative pathnames to be
resolved in unexpected ways in other threads or within
asynchronous signal or cancellation handlers.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This is not
enough of a reason to mark so-marked functions as MT-Unsafe,
but when this behavior is optional (e.g., <a href="https://man.page/3/nftw">nftw(3)</a>
with <b>FTW_CHDIR</b>), avoiding the option may be a good
alternative to using full pathnames or file
descriptor-relative (e.g., <a href="https://man.page/2/openat">openat(2)</a>) system
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>:identifier</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Annotations may sometimes be
followed by identifiers, intended to group several functions
that, for example, access the data structures in an unsafe
way, as in <i>race</i> and <i>const</i>, or to provide more
specific information, such as naming a signal in a function
marked with <i>sig</i>. It is envisioned that it may be
applied to <i>lock</i> and <i>corrupt</i> as well in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In most cases,
the identifier will name a set of functions, but it may name
global objects or function arguments, or identifiable
properties or logical components associated with them, with
a notation such as, for example, <i>:buf(arg)</i> to denote
a buffer associated with the argument <i>arg</i>, or
<i>:tcattr(fd)</i> to denote the terminal attributes of a
file descriptor <i>fd</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The most common
use for identifiers is to provide logical groups of
functions and arguments that need to be protected by the
same synchronization primitive in order to ensure safe
operation in a given context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/condition</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Some safety annotations may be
conditional, in that they only apply if a boolean expression
involving arguments, global variables or even the underlying
kernel evaluates to true. For example, <i>/!ps</i> and
<i>/one_per_line</i> indicate the preceding marker only
applies when argument <i>ps</i> is NULL, or global variable
<i>one_per_line</i> is nonzero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When all marks
that render a function unsafe are adorned with such
conditions, and none of the named conditions hold, then the
function can be regarded as safe.</p>
