<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Funding Free
Software</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
have more free software a few years from now, it makes sense
for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development. The most effective approach known is to
encourage commercial redistributors to donate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Users of free
software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their
selling price to free software developers---the Free
Software Foundation, and others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The way to
convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them. So when you compare distributors, judge them
partly by how much they give to free software development.
Show distributors they must compete to be the one who gives
the most.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make this
approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, &rsquo;&rsquo;We will donate ten dollars
to the Frobnitz project for each disk sold.&rsquo;&rsquo;
Don&rsquo;t be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
&rsquo;&rsquo;A portion of the profits are
donated,&rsquo;&rsquo; since it doesn&rsquo;t give a basis
for comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even a precise
fraction &rsquo;&rsquo;of the profits from this
disk&rsquo;&rsquo; is not very meaningful, since creative
accounting and unrelated business decisions can greatly
alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit. If
the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is
probably less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or
nothing at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
redistributors do development work themselves. This is
useful too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire
how much they do, and what kind. Some kinds of development
make much more long-term difference than others. For
example, maintaining a separate version of a program
contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of
a program for the whole community contributes much. Easy new
ports contribute little, since someone else would surely do
them; difficult ports such as adding a new
<small>CPU</small> to the <small>GNU</small> Compiler
Collection contribute more; major new features or packages
contribute the most.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By establishing
the idea that supporting further development is
&rsquo;&rsquo;the proper thing to do&rsquo;&rsquo; when
distributing free software for a fee, we can assure a steady
flow of resources into making more free software.</p>
