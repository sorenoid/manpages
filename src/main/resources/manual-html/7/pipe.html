<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pipe - overview
of pipes and FIFOs</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pipes and FIFOs
(also known as named pipes) provide a unidirectional
interprocess communication channel. A pipe has a <i>read
end</i> and a <i>write end</i>. Data written to the write
end of a pipe can be read from the read end of the pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A pipe is
created using <b>pipe</b>(2), which creates a new pipe and
returns two file descriptors, one referring to the read end
of the pipe, the other referring to the write end. Pipes can
be used to create a communication channel between related
processes; see <b>pipe</b>(2) for an example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A FIFO (short
for First In First Out) has a name within the filesystem
(created using <b>mkfifo</b>(3)), and is opened using
<b>open</b>(2). Any process may open a FIFO, assuming the
file permissions allow it. The read end is opened using the
<b>O_RDONLY</b> flag; the write end is opened using the
<b>O_WRONLY</b> flag. See <b>fifo</b>(7) for further
details. <i>Note</i>: although FIFOs have a pathname in the
filesystem, I/O on FIFOs does not involve operations on the
underlying device (if there is one).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I/O on pipes
and FIFOs</b> <br>
The only difference between pipes and FIFOs is the manner in
which they are created and opened. Once these tasks have
been accomplished, I/O on pipes and FIFOs has exactly the
same semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a process
attempts to read from an empty pipe, then <b>read</b>(2)
will block until data is available. If a process attempts to
write to a full pipe (see below), then <b>write</b>(2)
blocks until sufficient data has been read from the pipe to
allow the write to complete. Nonblocking I/O is possible by
using the <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_SETFL</b> operation to enable
the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> open file status flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
communication channel provided by a pipe is a <i>byte
stream</i>: there is no concept of message boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If all file
descriptors referring to the write end of a pipe have been
closed, then an attempt to <b>read</b>(2) from the pipe will
see end-of-file (<b>read</b>(2) will return 0). If all file
descriptors referring to the read end of a pipe have been
closed, then a <b>write</b>(2) will cause a <b>SIGPIPE</b>
signal to be generated for the calling process. If the
calling process is ignoring this signal, then
<b>write</b>(2) fails with the error <b>EPIPE</b>. An
application that uses <b>pipe</b>(2) and <b>fork</b>(2)
should use suitable <b>close</b>(2) calls to close
unnecessary duplicate file descriptors; this ensures that
end-of-file and <b>SIGPIPE</b>/<b>EPIPE</b> are delivered
when appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
possible to apply <b>lseek</b>(2) to a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pipe
capacity</b> <br>
A pipe has a limited capacity. If the pipe is full, then a
<b>write</b>(2) will block or fail, depending on whether the
<b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag is set (see below). Different
implementations have different limits for the pipe capacity.
Applications should not rely on a particular capacity: an
application should be designed so that a reading process
consumes data as soon as it is available, so that a writing
process does not remain blocked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Linux
versions before 2.6.11, the capacity of a pipe was the same
as the system page size (e.g., 4096 bytes on i386). Since
Linux 2.6.11, the pipe capacity is 16 pages (i.e., 65,536
bytes in a system with a page size of 4096 bytes). Since
Linux 2.6.35, the default pipe capacity is 16 pages, but the
capacity can be queried and set using the <b>fcntl</b>(2)
<b>F_GETPIPE_SZ</b> and <b>F_SETPIPE_SZ</b> operations. See
<b>fcntl</b>(2) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
<b>ioctl</b>(2) operation, which can be applied to a file
descriptor that refers to either end of a pipe, places a
count of the number of unread bytes in the pipe in the
<i>int</i> buffer pointed to by the final argument of the
call:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ioctl(fd,
FIONREAD, &amp;nbytes);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>FIONREAD</b> operation is not specified in any standard,
but is provided on many implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/proc
files</b> <br>
On Linux, the following files control how much memory can be
used for pipes: <i><br>
/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-pages</i> (only in Linux 2.6.34)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">An upper limit, in pages, on
the capacity that an unprivileged user (one without the
<b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b> capability) can set for a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value for this limit is 16 times the default pipe capacity
(see above); the lower limit is two pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This interface
was removed in Linux 2.6.35, in favor of
<i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size</i>
(since Linux 2.6.35)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum size (in bytes) of
individual pipes that can be set by users without the
<b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b> capability. The value assigned to
this file may be rounded upward, to reflect the value
actually employed for a convenient implementation. To
determine the rounded-up value, display the contents of this
file after assigning a value to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value for this file is 1048576 (1&nbsp;MiB). The minimum
value that can be assigned to this file is the system page
size. Attempts to set a limit less than the page size cause
<b>write</b>(2) to fail with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Since Linux
4.9, the value on this file also acts as a ceiling on the
default capacity of a new pipe or newly opened FIFO.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard</i>
(since Linux 4.5)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The hard limit on the total
size (in pages) of all pipes created or set by a single
unprivileged user (i.e., one with neither the
<b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b> nor the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>
capability). So long as the total number of pages allocated
to pipe buffers for this user is at this limit, attempts to
create new pipes will be denied, and attempts to increase a
pipe&rsquo;s capacity will be denied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When the value
of this limit is zero (which is the default), no hard limit
is applied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-soft</i>
(since Linux 4.5)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The soft limit on the total
size (in pages) of all pipes created or set by a single
unprivileged user (i.e., one with neither the
<b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b> nor the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>
capability). So long as the total number of pages allocated
to pipe buffers for this user is at this limit, individual
pipes created by a user will be limited to one page, and
attempts to increase a pipe&rsquo;s capacity will be
denied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When the value
of this limit is zero, no soft limit is applied. The default
value for this file is 16384, which permits creating up to
1024 pipes with the default capacity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Linux
4.9, some bugs affected the handling of the
<i>pipe-user-pages-soft</i> and <i>pipe-user-pages-hard</i>
limits; see BUGS.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PIPE_BUF</b>
<br>
POSIX.1 says that <b>write</b>(2)s of less than
<b>PIPE_BUF</b> bytes must be atomic: the output data is
written to the pipe as a contiguous sequence. Writes of more
than <b>PIPE_BUF</b> bytes may be nonatomic: the kernel may
interleave the data with data written by other processes.
POSIX.1 requires <b>PIPE_BUF</b> to be at least 512 bytes.
(On Linux, <b>PIPE_BUF</b> is 4096 bytes.) The precise
semantics depend on whether the file descriptor is
nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), whether there are multiple
writers to the pipe, and on <i>n</i>, the number of bytes to
be written: <b><br>
O_NONBLOCK</b> disabled, <i>n</i> &lt;= <b>PIPE_BUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">All <i>n</i> bytes are written
atomically; <b>write</b>(2) may block if there is not room
for <i>n</i> bytes to be written immediately</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b> enabled,
<i>n</i> &lt;= <b>PIPE_BUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If there is room to write
<i>n</i> bytes to the pipe, then <b>write</b>(2) succeeds
immediately, writing all <i>n</i> bytes; otherwise
<b>write</b>(2) fails, with <i>errno</i> set to
<b>EAGAIN</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b> disabled,
<i>n</i> &gt; <b>PIPE_BUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The write is nonatomic: the
data given to <b>write</b>(2) may be interleaved with
<b>write</b>(2)s by other process; the <b>write</b>(2)
blocks until <i>n</i> bytes have been written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b> enabled,
<i>n</i> &gt; <b>PIPE_BUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the pipe is full, then
<b>write</b>(2) fails, with <i>errno</i> set to
<b>EAGAIN</b>. Otherwise, from 1 to <i>n</i> bytes may be
written (i.e., a &quot;partial write&quot; may occur; the
caller should check the return value from <b>write</b>(2) to
see how many bytes were actually written), and these bytes
may be interleaved with writes by other processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Open file
status flags</b> <br>
The only open file status flags that can be meaningfully
applied to a pipe or FIFO are <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> and
<b>O_ASYNC</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Setting the
<b>O_ASYNC</b> flag for the read end of a pipe causes a
signal (<b>SIGIO</b> by default) to be generated when new
input becomes available on the pipe. The target for delivery
of signals must be set using the <b>fcntl</b>(2)
<b>F_SETOWN</b> command. On Linux, <b>O_ASYNC</b> is
supported for pipes and FIFOs only since kernel 2.6.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Portability
notes</b> <br>
On some systems (but not Linux), pipes are bidirectional:
data can be transmitted in both directions between the pipe
ends. POSIX.1 requires only unidirectional pipes. Portable
applications should avoid reliance on bidirectional pipe
semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>BUGS</b>
<br>
Before Linux 4.9, some bugs affected the handling of the
<i>pipe-user-pages-soft</i> and <i>pipe-user-pages-hard</i>
limits when using the <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_SETPIPE_SZ</b>
operation to change a pipe&rsquo;s capacity:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>(1)</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>When increasing the pipe capacity, the checks against
the soft and hard limits were made against existing
consumption, and excluded the memory required for the
increased pipe capacity. The new increase in pipe capacity
could then push the total memory used by the user for pipes
(possibly far) over a limit. (This could also trigger the
problem described next.)</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Starting with
Linux 4.9, the limit checking includes the memory required
for the new pipe capacity.</p>

<td width="82%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The limit checks were performed
even when the new pipe capacity was less than the existing
pipe capacity. This could lead to problems if a user set a
large pipe capacity, and then the limits were lowered, with
the result that the user could no longer decrease the pipe
capacity.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Starting with
Linux 4.9, checks against the limits are performed only when
increasing a pipe&rsquo;s capacity; an unprivileged user can

</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">This was racey.
Multiple processes could pass point (a) simultaneously, and
then allocate pipe buffers that were accounted for only in
step (c), with the result that the user&rsquo;s pipe buffer
allocation could be pushed over the limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Starting with
Linux 4.9, the accounting step is performed before doing the
allocation, and the operation fails if the limit would be
exceeded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Linux
4.9, bugs similar to points (1) and (3) could also occur
when the kernel allocated memory for a new pipe buffer; that
is, when calling <b>pipe</b>(2) and when opening a
previously unopened FIFO.</p>
