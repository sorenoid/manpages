<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The purpose of
this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <i>free</i> in the sense of
freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy

preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">We have
designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
free software, because free software needs free
documentation: a free program should come with manuals
providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this

</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This License
applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a
notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited
in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated
herein. The &rsquo;&rsquo;Document&rsquo;&rsquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public
is a licensee, and is addressed as
&rsquo;&rsquo;you&rsquo;&rsquo;. You accept the license if
you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring
permission under copyright law.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A
&rsquo;&rsquo;Modified Version&rsquo;&rsquo; of the Document
means any work containing the Document or a portion of it,
either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A
&rsquo;&rsquo;Secondary Section&rsquo;&rsquo; is a named
appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that
deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that
could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if
the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
regarding them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&rsquo;&rsquo;Invariant Sections&rsquo;&rsquo; are certain
Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being
those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. If a section
does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is
not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may
contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not
identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&rsquo;&rsquo;Cover Texts&rsquo;&rsquo; are certain short
passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or
Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document
is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at
most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
words.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A
&rsquo;&rsquo;Transparent&rsquo;&rsquo; copy of the Document
means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose
specification is available to the general public, that is
suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels)
generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made
in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or
absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An
image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
amount of text. A copy that is not
&rsquo;&rsquo;Transparent&rsquo;&rsquo; is called
&rsquo;&rsquo;Opaque&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Examples of
suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input format,
LaTeX input format, @acronym{ <small>SGML</small> } or
@acronym{ <small>XML</small> } using a publicly available
@acronym{ <small>DTD</small> }, and standard-conforming
simple @acronym{ <small>HTML</small> }, PostScript or
@acronym{ <small>PDF</small> } designed for human
modification. Examples of transparent image formats include
@acronym{ <small>PNG</small> }, @acronym{ <small>XCF</small>
} and @acronym{ <small>JPG</small> }. Opaque formats include
proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, @acronym{ <small>SGML</small> }
or @acronym{ <small>XML</small> } for which the @acronym{
<small>DTD</small> } and/or processing tools are not
generally available, and the machine-generated @acronym{
<small>HTML</small> }, PostScript or @acronym{
<small>PDF</small> } produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&rsquo;&rsquo;Title Page&rsquo;&rsquo; means, for a printed
book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as
are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such,
&rsquo;&rsquo;Title Page&rsquo;&rsquo; means the text near
the most prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A section
&rsquo;&rsquo;Entitled <small>XYZ</small> &rsquo;&rsquo;
means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is
precisely <small>XYZ</small> or contains <small>XYZ</small>
in parentheses following text that translates
<small>XYZ</small> in another language. (Here
<small>XYZ</small> stands for a specific section name
mentioned below, such as
&rsquo;&rsquo;Acknowledgements&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;Dedications&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;Endorsements&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;&rsquo;History&rsquo;&rsquo;.) To
&rsquo;&rsquo;Preserve the Title&rsquo;&rsquo; of such a
section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &rsquo;&rsquo;Entitled <small>XYZ</small>
&rsquo;&rsquo; according to this definition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The Document
may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document. These
Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by
reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming
warranties: any other implication that these Warranty
Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.</p>

copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to
those of this License. You may not use technical measures to
obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a
large enough number of copies you must also follow the
conditions in section 3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you publish
printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
and the Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover
Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry,
clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must
present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the
covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document
and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the required
texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
adjacent pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you publish
or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or
with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which
the general network-using public has access to download
using public-standard network protocols a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent
steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
(directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is
requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
the Document well before redistributing any large number of
copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
version of the Document.</p>

How to use this License for your documents</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use this
License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright
and license notices just after the title page:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Copyright (C)
&lt;year&gt; &lt;your name&gt;. <br>
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
document <br>
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
Version 1.2 <br>
or any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation; <br>
with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
Back-Cover Texts. <br>
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled
&rsquo;&rsquo;GNU <br>
Free Documentation License&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &rsquo;&rsquo;with...Texts.&rsquo;&rsquo; line
with this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">with the
Invariant Sections being &lt;list their titles&gt;, with
<br>
the Front-Cover Texts being &lt;list&gt;, and with the
Back-Cover Texts <br>
being &lt;list&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to
suit the situation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your
document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
choice of free software license, such as the
<small>GNU</small> General Public License, to permit their
use in free software.</p>
