<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A few units are
treated specially by systemd. Many of them have special
internal semantics and cannot be renamed, while others
simply have a standard meaning and should be present on all
systems.</p>

<h2>UNITS MANAGED BY THE SYSTEM SERVICE MANAGER
<a name="UNITS MANAGED BY THE SYSTEM SERVICE MANAGER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Special
System Units</b> <br>
-.mount</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The root mount point, i.e. the
mount unit for the / path. This unit is unconditionally
active, during the entire time the system is up, as this
mount point is where the basic userspace is running
from.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">basic.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit covering
basic boot-up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">systemd
automatically adds dependency of the type <i>After=</i> for
this target unit to all services (except for those with
<i>DefaultDependencies=no</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Usually, this
should pull-in all local mount points plus /var/, /tmp/ and
/var/tmp/, swap devices, sockets, timers, path units and
other basic initialization necessary for general purpose
daemons. The mentioned mount points are special cased to
allow them to be remote.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This target
usually does not pull in any non-target units directly, but
rather does so indirectly via other early boot targets. It
is instead meant as a synchronization point for late boot
services. Refer to <a href="https://man.page/7/bootup">bootup(7)</a> for details on the
targets involved.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">boot-complete.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This target is intended as
generic synchronization point for services that shall
determine or act on whether the boot process completed
successfully. Order units that are required to succeed for a
boot process to be considered successful before this unit,
and add a <i>Requires=</i> dependency from the target unit
to them. Order units that shall only run when the boot
process is considered successful after the target unit and
pull in the target from it, also with <i>Requires=</i>. Note
that by default this target unit is not part of the initial
boot transaction, but is supposed to be pulled in only if
required by units that want to run only on successful
boots.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>systemd-boot-check-no-failures.service</b>(8) for a
service that implements a generic system health check and
orders itself before boot-complete.target.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>systemd-bless-boot.service</b>(8) for a service that
propagates boot success information to the boot loader, and
orders itself after boot-complete.target.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ctrl-alt-del.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">systemd starts this target
whenever Control+Alt+Del is pressed on the console. Usually,
this should be aliased (symlinked) to reboot.target.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cryptsetup.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A target that pulls in setup
services for all encrypted block devices.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">veritysetup.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A target that pulls in setup
services for all verity integrity protected block
devices.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dbus.service</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special unit for the D-Bus
bus daemon. As soon as this service is fully started up
systemd will connect to it and register its service.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dbus.socket</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special unit for the D-Bus
system bus socket. All units with <i>Type=dbus</i>
automatically gain a dependency on this unit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">default.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default unit systemd starts
at bootup. Usually, this should be aliased (symlinked) to
multi-user.target or graphical.target. See <a href="https://man.page/7/bootup">bootup(7)</a>
for more discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
unit systemd starts at bootup can be overridden with the
<i>systemd.unit=</i> kernel command line option, or more
conveniently, with the short names like <i>single</i>,
<i>rescue</i>, <i>1</i>, <i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, ...; see
<a href="https://man.page/1/systemd">systemd(1)</a>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">display-manager.service</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The display manager service.
Usually, this should be aliased (symlinked) to gdm.service
or a similar display manager service.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">emergency.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit that
starts an emergency shell on the main console. This target
does not pull in other services or mounts. It is the most
minimal version of starting the system in order to acquire
an interactive shell; the only processes running are usually
just the system manager (PID 1) and the shell process. This
unit may be used by specifying <i>emergency</i> on the
kernel command line; it is also used when a file system
check on a required file system fails and boot-up cannot
continue. Compare with rescue.target, which serves a similar
purpose, but also starts the most basic services and mounts
all file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In many ways
booting into emergency.target is similar to the effect of
booting with &quot;init=/bin/sh&quot; on the kernel command
line, except that emergency mode provides you with the full
system and service manager, and allows starting individual
units in order to continue the boot process in steps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
depending on how emergency.target is reached, the root file
system might be mounted read-only or read-write (no
remounting is done specially for this target). For example,
the system may boot with root mounted read-only when
<i>ro</i> is used on the kernel command line and remain this
way for emergency.target, or the system may transition to
emergency.target after the system has been partially booted
and disks have already been remounted read-write.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">exit.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special service unit for
shutting down the system or user service manager. It is
equivalent to poweroff.target on non-container systems, and
also works in containers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">systemd will
start this unit when it receives the <b>SIGTERM</b> or
<b>SIGINT</b> signal when running as user service
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, this
(indirectly) pulls in shutdown.target, which in turn should
be conflicted by all units that want to be scheduled for
shutdown when the service manager starts to exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">final.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit that is
used during the shutdown logic and may be used to pull in
late services after all normal services are already
terminated and all mounts unmounted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">getty.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit that
pulls in statically configured local TTY getty
instances.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">graphical.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit for
setting up a graphical login screen. This pulls in
multi-user.target.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Units that are
needed for graphical logins shall add <i>Wants=</i>
dependencies for their unit to this unit (or
multi-user.target) during installation. This is best
configured via <i>WantedBy=graphical.target</i> in the
unit's [Install] section.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hibernate.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit for
hibernating the system. This pulls in sleep.target.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hybrid-sleep.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit for
hibernating and suspending the system at the same time. This
pulls in sleep.target.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">suspend-then-hibernate.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit for
suspending the system for a period of time, waking it and
putting it into hibernate. This pulls in sleep.target.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">halt.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit for
shutting down and halting the system. Note that this target
is distinct from poweroff.target in that it generally really
just halts the system rather than powering it down.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
wanting to halt the system should not start this unit
directly, but should instead execute <b>systemctl halt</b>
(possibly with the <b>--no-block</b> option) or call
<a href="https://man.page/1/systemd">systemd(1)</a>'s
<b>org.freedesktop.systemd1.Manager.Halt</b> D-Bus method
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">init.scope</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This scope unit is where the
system and service manager (PID 1) itself resides. It is
active as long as the system is running.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">initrd.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is the default target in
the initramfs, similar to default.target in the main system.
It is used to mount the real root and transition to it. See
<a href="https://man.page/7/bootup">bootup(7)</a> for more discussion.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">initrd-fs.target</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><a href="https://man.page/3/systemd-fstab-generator">systemd-fstab-generator(3)</a>
automatically adds dependencies of type <i>Before=</i> to
sysroot-usr.mount and all mount points found in /etc/fstab
that have the <b>x-initrd.mount</b> mount option set and do
not have the <b>noauto</b> mount option set. It is also
indirectly ordered after sysroot.mount. Thus, once this
target is reached the /sysroot/ hierarchy is fully set up,
in preparation for the transition to the host OS.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">initrd-root-device.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special initrd target unit
that is reached when the root filesystem device is
available, but before it has been mounted.
<a href="https://man.page/3/systemd-fstab-generator">systemd-fstab-generator(3)</a> and
<a href="https://man.page/3/systemd-gpt-auto-generator">systemd-gpt-auto-generator(3)</a> automatically setup the
appropriate dependencies to make this happen.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">initrd-root-fs.target</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><a href="https://man.page/3/systemd-fstab-generator">systemd-fstab-generator(3)</a>
automatically adds dependencies of type <i>Before=</i> to
the sysroot.mount unit, which is generated from the kernel
command line's <i>root=</i> setting (or equivalent).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">initrd-usr-fs.target</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><a href="https://man.page/3/systemd-fstab-generator">systemd-fstab-generator(3)</a>
automatically adds dependencies of type <i>Before=</i> to
the sysusr-usr.mount unit, which is generated from the
kernel command line's <i>usr=</i> switch. Services may order
themselves after this target unit in order to run once the
/sysusr/ hierarchy becomes available, on systems that come
up initially without a root file system, but with an
initialized /usr/ and need to access that before setting up
the root file system to ultimately switch to. On systems
where <i>usr=</i> is not used this target is ordered after
sysroot.mount and thus mostly equivalent to
initrd-root-fs.target. In effect on any system once this
target is reached the file system backing /usr/ is mounted,
though possibly at two different locations, either below the
/sysusr/ or the /sysroot/ hierarchies.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">kbrequest.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">systemd starts this target
whenever Alt+ArrowUp is pressed on the console. Note that
any user with physical access to the machine will be able to
do this, without authentication, so this should be used
carefully.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">kexec.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit for
shutting down and rebooting the system via kexec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
wanting to reboot the system should not start this unit
directly, but should instead execute <b>systemctl kexec</b>
(possibly with the <b>--no-block</b> option) or call
<a href="https://man.page/1/systemd">systemd(1)</a>'s
<b>org.freedesktop.systemd1.Manager.KExec</b> D-Bus method
directly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">local-fs.target</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><a href="https://man.page/3/systemd-fstab-generator">systemd-fstab-generator(3)</a>
automatically adds dependencies of type <i>Before=</i> to
all mount units that refer to local mount points for this
target unit. In addition, it adds dependencies of type
<i>Wants=</i> to this target unit for those mounts listed in
/etc/fstab that have the <b>auto</b> mount option set.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">machines.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A standard target unit for
starting all the containers and other virtual machines. See
systemd-nspawn@.service for an example.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">multi-user.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special target unit for
setting up a multi-user system (non-graphical). This is
pulled in by graphical.target.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Units that are
needed for a multi-user system shall add <i>Wants=</i>
dependencies for their unit to this unit during
installation. This is best configured via
<i>WantedBy=multi-user.target</i> in the unit's [Install]
section.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">network-online.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Units that strictly require a
configured network connection should pull in
network-online.target (via a <i>Wants=</i> type dependency)
and order themselves after it. This target unit is intended
to pull in a service that delays further execution until the
network is sufficiently set up. What precisely this requires
is left to the implementation of the network managing
service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the
distinction between this unit and network.target. This unit
is an active unit (i.e. pulled in by the consumer rather
than the provider of this functionality) and pulls in a
service which possibly adds substantial delays to further
execution. In contrast, network.target is a passive unit
(i.e. pulled in by the provider of the functionality, rather
than the consumer) that usually does not delay execution
much. Usually, network.target is part of the boot of most
systems, while network-online.target is not, except when at
least one unit requires it. Also see
<b><font color="#0000FF">Running Services After the Network
is up</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">for more information.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">All
mount units for remote network file systems automatically
pull in this unit, and order themselves after it. Note that
networking daemons that simply <i>provide</i> functionality
to other hosts (as opposed to <i>consume</i> functionality
of other hosts) generally do not need to pull this
in.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">systemd
automatically adds dependencies of type <i>Wants=</i> and
<i>After=</i> for this target unit to all SysV init script
service units with an LSB header referring to the
&quot;$network&quot; facility.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that this unit is only useful during the original system
start-up logic. After the system has completed booting up,
it will not track the online state of the system anymore.
Due to this it cannot be used as a network connection
monitor concept, it is purely a one-time system start-up
concept.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">paths.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A special
target unit that sets up all path units (see
<b>systemd.path</b>(5) for details) that shall be active
after boot.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">It
is recommended that path units installed by applications get
pulled in via <i>Wants=</i> dependencies from this unit.
This is best configured via a <i>WantedBy=paths.target</i>
in the path unit's [Install] section.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">poweroff.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A special
target unit for shutting down and powering off the
system.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Applications
wanting to power off the system should not start this unit
directly, but should instead execute <b>systemctl
poweroff</b> (possibly with the <b>--no-block</b> option) or
call <b>systemd-logind</b>(8)'s
<b>org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.PowerOff</b> D-Bus method
directly.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">runlevel0.target
is an alias for this target unit, for compatibility with
SysV.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">reboot.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A special
target unit for shutting down and rebooting the
system.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Applications
wanting to reboot the system should not start this unit
directly, but should instead execute <b>systemctl reboot</b>
(possibly with the <b>--no-block</b> option) or call
<b>systemd-logind</b>(8)'s
<b>org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.Reboot</b> D-Bus method
directly.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">runlevel6.target
is an alias for this target unit, for compatibility with
SysV.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">remote-cryptsetup.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Similar
to cryptsetup.target, but for encrypted devices which are
accessed over the network. It is used for <b>crypttab</b>(8)
entries marked with <b>_netdev</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">remote-veritysetup.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Similar
to veritysetup.target, but for verity integrity protected
devices which are accessed over the network. It is used for
<b>veritytab</b>(8) entries marked with
<b>_netdev</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">remote-fs.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Similar
to local-fs.target, but for remote mount points.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">systemd
automatically adds dependencies of type <i>After=</i> for
this target unit to all SysV init script service units with
an LSB header referring to the &quot;$remote_fs&quot;
facility.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">rescue.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A special
target unit that pulls in the base system (including system
mounts) and spawns a rescue shell. Isolate to this target in
order to administer the system in single-user mode with all
file systems mounted but with no services running, except
for the most basic. Compare with emergency.target, which is
much more reduced and does not provide the file systems or
most basic services. Compare with multi-user.target, this
target could be seen as single-user.target.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">runlevel1.target
is an alias for this target unit, for compatibility with
SysV.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Use
the &quot;systemd.unit=rescue.target&quot; kernel command
line option to boot into this mode. A short alias for this
kernel command line option is &quot;1&quot;, for
compatibility with SysV.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">runlevel2.target,
runlevel3.target, runlevel4.target,
runlevel5.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">These are
targets that are called whenever the SysV compatibility code
asks for runlevel 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively. It is a good
idea to make this an alias for (i.e. symlink to)
graphical.target (for runlevel 5) or multi-user.target (the
others).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">shutdown.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A special
target unit that terminates the services on system
shutdown.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Services
that shall be terminated on system shutdown shall add
<i>Conflicts=</i> and <i>Before=</i> dependencies to this
unit for their service unit, which is implicitly done when
<i>DefaultDependencies=yes</i> is set (the
default).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">sigpwr.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A special
target that is started when systemd receives the SIGPWR
process signal, which is normally sent by the kernel or UPS
daemons when power fails.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">sleep.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A special
target unit that is pulled in by suspend.target,

Passive System Units</b> <br>
A number of special system targets are defined that can be
used to properly order boot-up of optional services. These
targets are generally not part of the initial boot
transaction, unless they are explicitly pulled in by one of
the implementing services. Note specifically that these
<i>passive</i> target units are generally not pulled in by
the consumer of a service, but by the provider of the
service. This means: a consuming service should order itself
after these targets (as appropriate), but not pull it in. A
providing service should order itself before these targets
(as appropriate) and pull it in (via a <i>Wants=</i> type
dependency).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that these passive units cannot be started manually, i.e.
&quot;systemctl start time-sync.target&quot; will fail with
an error. They can only be pulled in by dependency. This is
enforced since they exist for ordering purposes only and
thus are not useful as only unit within a
transaction.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">blockdev@.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
template unit is used to order mount units and other
consumers of block devices after services that synthesize
these block devices. In particular, this is intended to be
used with storage services (such as
<b>systemd-cryptsetup@.service</b>(5)/
<b>systemd-veritysetup@.service</b>(5)) that allocate and
manage a virtual block device. Storage services are ordered
before an instance of blockdev@.target, and the consumer
units after it. The ordering is particularly relevant during
shutdown, as it ensures that the mount is deactivated first
and the service backing the mount later. The
blockdev@.target instance should be pulled in via a
<b>Wants=</b> dependency of the storage daemon and thus
generally not be part of any transaction unless a storage
daemon is used. The instance name for instances of this
template unit must be a properly escaped block device node
path, e.g. blockdev@dev-mapper-foobar.target for the storage
device /dev/mapper/foobar.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">cryptsetup-pre.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
passive target unit may be pulled in by services that want
to run before any encrypted block device is set up. All
encrypted block devices are set up after this target has
been reached. Since the shutdown order is implicitly the
reverse start-up order between units, this target is
particularly useful to ensure that a service is shut down
only after all encrypted block devices are fully
stopped.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This unit

supposed to mean. However, the following should apply at
minimum:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
At start-up, any configured synthetic network devices (i.e.
not physical ones that require hardware to show up and be
probed, but virtual ones like bridge devices and similar
which are created programmatically) that do not depend on
any underlying hardware should be allocated by the time this
target is reached. It is not necessary for these interfaces
to also have completed IP level configuration by the time
network.target is reached.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
At shutdown, a unit that is ordered after network.target
will be stopped before the network &mdash; to whatever level
it might be set up by then &mdash; is shut down. It is hence
useful when writing service files that require network
access on shutdown, which should order themselves after this
target, but not pull it in. Also see</font>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">graphical-session-pre.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
target contains services which set up the environment or
global configuration of a graphical session, such as SSH/GPG
agents (which need to export an environment variable into
all desktop processes) or migration of obsolete d-conf keys
after an OS upgrade (which needs to happen before starting
any process that might use them). This target must be
started before starting a graphical session like
gnome-session.target.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">xdg-desktop-autostart.target</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The XDG
specification defines a way to autostart applications using
XDG desktop files. systemd ships
<b>systemd-xdg-autostart-generator</b>(8) for the XDG
desktop files in autostart directories. Desktop Environments
can opt-in to use this service by adding a <i>Wants=</i>
dependency on xdg-desktop-autostart.target.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Special
User Slice Units</b> <br>
There are four &quot;.slice&quot; units which form the basis
of the user hierarchy for assignment of resources for user
applications and services. See <b>systemd.slice</b>(7) for
details about slice units and the documentation about</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">Desktop Environments</font></b>

<font color="#000000">for further information.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">-.slice</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The root
slice is the root of the user's slice hierarchy. It usually
does not contain units directly, but may be used to set
defaults for the whole tree.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">app.slice</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">By
default, all user services and applications managed by
<b>systemd</b> are found in this slice. All interactively
launched applications like web browsers and text editors as
well as non-critical services should be placed into this
slice.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">session.slice</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">All
essential services and applications required for the session
should use this slice. These are services that either cannot
be restarted easily or where latency issues may affect the
interactivity of the system and applications. This includes
the display server, screen readers and other services such
as DBus or XDG portals. Such services should be configured
to be part of this slice by adding
<i>Slice=session.slice</i> to their unit files.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">background.slice</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">All
services running low-priority background tasks should use
this slice. This permits resources to be preferentially
assigned to the other slices. Examples include
non-interactive tasks like file indexing or backup
operations where latency is not important.</font></p>
