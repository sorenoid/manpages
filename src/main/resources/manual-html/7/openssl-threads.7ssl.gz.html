<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">openssl-threads
- Overview of thread safety in OpenSSL</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this man
page, we use the term <b>thread-safe</b> to indicate that an
object or function can be used by multiple threads at the
same time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenSSL can be
built with or without threads support. The most important
use of this support is so that OpenSSL itself can use a
single consistent <small>API,</small> as shown in &quot;
<small>EXAMPLES&quot;</small> in
<a href="https://man.page/3/CRYPTO_THREAD_run_once">CRYPTO_THREAD_run_once(3)</a>. Multi-platform
applications can also use this <small>API.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In particular,
being configured for threads support does not imply that all
OpenSSL objects are thread-safe. To emphasize: <i>most
objects are not safe for simultaneous use</i>. Exceptions to
this should be documented on the specific manual pages, and
some general high-level guidance is given here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One major use
of the OpenSSL thread <small>API</small> is to implement
reference counting. Many objects within OpenSSL are
reference-counted, so resources are not released, until the
last reference is removed. References are often increased
automatically (such as when an <b>X509</b> certificate
object is added into an <b>X509_STORE</b> trust store).
There is often an <b><i>object</i></b><b>_up_ref</b>()
function that can be used to increase the reference count.
Failure to match <b><i>object</i></b><b>_up_ref</b>() calls
with the right number of <b><i>object</i></b><b>_free</b>()
calls is a common source of memory leaks when a program
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many objects
have set and get <small>API</small> &rsquo;s to set
attributes in the object. A &quot;set0&quot; passes
ownership from the caller to the object and a
&quot;get0&quot; returns a pointer but the attribute
ownership remains with the object and a reference to it is
returned. A &quot;set1&quot; or &quot;get1&quot; function
does not change the ownership, but instead updates the
attribute&rsquo;s reference count so that the object is
shared between the caller and the object; the caller must
free the returned attribute when finished. Functions that
involve attributes that have reference counts themselves,
but are named with just &quot;set&quot; or &quot;get&quot;
are historical; and the documentation must state how the
references are handled. Get methods are often thread-safe as
long as the ownership requirements are met and shared
objects are not modified. Set methods, or modifying shared
objects, are generally not thread-safe as discussed
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Objects are
thread-safe as long as the <small>API</small> &rsquo;s being
invoked don&rsquo;t modify the object; in this case the
parameter is usually marked in the <small>API</small> as
&quot;const&quot;. Not all parameters are marked this way.
Note that a &quot;const&quot; declaration does not mean
immutable; for example <a href="https://man.page/3/X509_cmp">X509_cmp(3)</a> takes pointers to
&quot;const&quot; objects, but the implementation uses a C
cast to remove that so it can lock objects, generate and
cache a <small>DER</small> encoding, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another
instance of thread-safety is when updates to an
object&rsquo;s internal state, such as cached values, are
done with locks. One example of this is the reference
counting <small>API</small> &rsquo;s described above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In all cases,
however, it is generally not safe for one thread to mutate
an object, such as setting elements of a private or public
key, while another thread is using that object, such as
verifying a signature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The same
<small>API</small> &rsquo;s can usually be used
simultaneously on different objects without interference.
For example, two threads can calculate a signature using two
different <b><small>EVP_PKEY_CTX</small></b> objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For implicit
global state or singletons, thread-safety depends on the
facility. The <a href="https://man.page/3/CRYPTO_secure_malloc">CRYPTO_secure_malloc(3)</a> and related
<small>API</small> &rsquo;s have their own lock, while
<a href="https://man.page/3/CRYPTO_malloc">CRYPTO_malloc(3)</a> assumes the underlying platform
allocation will do any necessary locking. Some
<small>API</small> &rsquo;s, such as <a href="https://man.page/3/NCONF_load">NCONF_load(3)</a>
and related, or <a href="https://man.page/3/OBJ_create">OBJ_create(3)</a> do no locking at all;
this can be considered a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A separate,
although related, issue is modifying &quot;factory&quot;
objects when other objects have been created from that. For
example, an <b><small>SSL_CTX</small></b> object created by
<a href="https://man.page/3/SSL_CTX_new">SSL_CTX_new(3)</a> is used to create per-connection
<b><small>SSL</small></b> objects by calling
<a href="https://man.page/3/SSL_new">SSL_new(3)</a>. In this specific case, and probably for
factory methods in general, it is not safe to modify the
factory object after it has been used to create other
objects.</p>
