<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">passphrase-encoding
- How diverse parts of OpenSSL treat pass phrases character
encoding</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a modern
world with all sorts of character encodings, the treatment
of pass phrases has become increasingly complex. This manual
page attempts to give an overview over how this problem is
currently addressed in different parts of the OpenSSL
library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The general
case</b> <br>
The OpenSSL library doesn&rsquo;t treat pass phrases in any
special way as a general rule, and trusts the application or
user to choose a suitable character set and stick to that
throughout the lifetime of affected objects. This means that
for an object that was encrypted using a pass phrase encoded
in <small>ISO-8859-1,</small> that object needs to be
decrypted using a pass phrase encoded in
<small>ISO-8859-1.</small> Using the wrong encoding is
expected to cause a decryption failure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PKCS#12</b>
<br>
PKCS#12 is a bit different regarding pass phrase encoding.
The standard stipulates that the pass phrase shall be
encoded as an <small>ASN.1</small> BMPString, which consists
of the code points of the basic multilingual plane, encoded
in big endian ( <small>UCS-2 BE</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenSSL tries
to adapt to this requirements in one of the following
manners:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Treats the received pass phrase as <small>UTF-8</small>
encoded and tries to re-encode it to <small>UTF-16</small>
(which is the same as <small>UCS-2</small> for characters
U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+FFFF, but becomes an
expansion for any other character), or failing that,
proceeds with step 2.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Assumes that the pass phrase is encoded in
<small>ASCII</small> or <small>ISO-8859-1</small> and
opportunistically prepends each byte with a zero byte to
obtain the <small>UCS-2</small> encoding of the characters,
which it stores as a BMPString.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that since
there is no check of your locale, this may produce
<small>UCS-2 / UTF-16</small> characters that do not
correspond to the original pass phrase characters for other
character sets, such as any <small>ISO-8859-X</small>
encoding other than <small>ISO-8859-1</small> (or for
Windows, <small>CP 1252</small> with exception for the extra
&quot;graphical&quot; characters in the 0x80-0x9F
range).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenSSL
versions older than 1.1.0 do variant 2 only, and that is the
reason why OpenSSL still does this, to be able to read files
produced with older versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It should be
noted that this approach isn&rsquo;t entirely fault
free.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A pass phrase
encoded in <small>ISO-8859-2</small> could very well have a
sequence such as 0xC3 0xAF (which is the two characters
&quot; <small>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH
BREVE&quot;</small> and &quot; <small>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z
WITH DOT ABOVE&quot;</small> in <small>ISO-8859-2</small>
encoding), but would be misinterpreted as the perfectly
valid <small>UTF-8</small> encoded code point U+00EF (
<small>LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH DIAERESIS</small> ) <i>if
the pass phrase doesn&rsquo;t contain anything that would be
invalid <small>UTF-8</small></i> . A pass phrase that
contains this kind of byte sequence will give a different
outcome in OpenSSL 1.1.0 and newer than in OpenSSL older
than 1.1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">0x00 0xC3 0x00
0xAF # OpenSSL older than 1.1.0 <br>
0x00 0xEF # OpenSSL 1.1.0 and newer</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the same
accord, anything encoded in <small>UTF-8</small> that was
given to OpenSSL older than 1.1.0 was misinterpreted as
<small>ISO-8859-1</small> sequences.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>OSSL_STORE</small>
<br>
ossl_store</b>(7) acts as a general interface to access all
kinds of objects, potentially protected with a pass phrase,
a <small>PIN</small> or something else. This
<small>API</small> stipulates that pass phrases should be
<small>UTF-8</small> encoded, and that any other pass phrase
encoding may give undefined results. This <small>API</small>
relies on the application to ensure <small>UTF-8</small>
encoding, and doesn&rsquo;t check that this is the case, so
what it gets, it will also pass to the underlying
loader.</p>

<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS
<a name="RECOMMENDATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
assumes that you know what pass phrase was used for
encryption, but that it may have been encoded in a different
character encoding than the one used by your current input
method. For example, the pass phrase may have been used at a
time when your default encoding was
<small>ISO-8859-1</small> (i.e. &quot;naieve&quot; resulting
in the byte sequence 0x6E 0x61 0xEF 0x76 0x65), and
you&rsquo;re now in an environment where your default
encoding is <small>UTF-8</small> (i.e. &quot;naieve&quot;
resulting in the byte sequence 0x6E 0x61 0xC3 0xAF 0x76
0x65). Whenever it&rsquo;s mentioned that you should use a
certain character encoding, it should be understood that you
either change the input method to use the mentioned encoding
when you type in your pass phrase, or use some suitable tool
to convert your pass phrase from your default encoding to
the target encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also note that
the sub-sections below discuss human readable pass phrases.
This is particularly relevant for PKCS#12 objects, where
human readable pass phrases are assumed. For other objects,
it&rsquo;s as legitimate to use any byte sequence (such as a
sequence of bytes from <i>/dev/urandom</i> that&rsquo;s been
saved away), which makes any character encoding discussion
irrelevant; in such cases, simply use the same byte sequence
as it is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Creating new
objects</b> <br>
For creating new pass phrase protected objects, make sure
the pass phrase is encoded using <small>UTF-8.</small> This
is default on most modern Unixes, but may involve an effort
on other platforms. Specifically for Windows, setting the
environment variable
<b><small>OPENSSL_WIN32_UTF8</small></b> will have anything
entered on [Windows] console prompt converted to
<small>UTF-8</small> (command line and separately prompted
pass phrases alike).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Opening
existing objects</b> <br>
For opening pass phrase protected objects where you know
what character encoding was used for the encryption pass
phrase, make sure to use the same encoding again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For opening
pass phrase protected objects where the character encoding
that was used is unknown, or where the producing application
is unknown, try one of the following:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try the pass phrase that you
have as it is in the character encoding of your environment.
It&rsquo;s possible that its byte sequence is exactly
right.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Convert the pass phrase to <small>UTF-8</small> and try
with the result. Specifically with PKCS#12, this should open
up any object that was created according to the
specification.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Do a naieve (i.e. purely mathematical)
<small>ISO-8859-1</small> to <small>UTF-8</small> conversion
and try with the result. This differs from the previous
attempt because <small>ISO-8859-1</small> maps directly to
U+0000 to U+00FF, which other non-UTF-8 character sets do
not.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This also takes
care of the case when a <small>UTF-8</small> encoded string
was used with OpenSSL older than 1.1.0. (for example,
&quot;ie&quot;, which is 0xC3 0xAF when encoded in
<small>UTF-8,</small> would become 0xC3 0x83 0xC2 0xAF when
re-encoded in the naieve manner. The conversion to BMPString
would then yield 0x00 0xC3 0x00 0xA4 0x00 0x00, the
erroneous/non-compliant encoding used by OpenSSL older than
1.1.0)</p>
