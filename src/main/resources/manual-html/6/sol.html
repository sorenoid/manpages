<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This text is
taken verbatim from the AisleRiot Manual V2.12.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Moving the
cards is reasonably obvious. Assuming you have a
right-handed mouse, left-click on a card and drag it
somewhere. Release the mouse button to deposit the card.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a card can
be moved to the foundation(s), you do not need to drag it.
You can double-click on it and it will move. If a sequence
of cards can be moved to the foundations, you can generally
move the sequence as one move.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Double clicking
a card will send it to a foundation, if that is possible.
This is useful for cleaning up large numbers of cards at the
end of a successful game.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In games which
have a stock pile you can redeal it by clicking on the empty
space where it was. Be warned that some games only let you
do this a limited number of time. Watch for the Redeals Left
message at the bottom of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A useful tip to
know is that right-clicking on a face-up card which is
partially obscured by a card laid over it will raise it so
that you can see what it is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is an
alternative way to move cards. By selecting <b>Click to
move</b> from the <b>Control</b> menu you can click once to
pick up a card and then click again to place it. This can be
faster than dragging and will be easier on your hand since
you don&rsquo;t have to hold the mouse down. However, it may
take a while to get used to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some games have
options to change the way the game is played. For example
Klondike can be played with either single card deals or
three-card deals. In these games there is a separate menu
with the game&rsquo;s name. You can only change the rules of
the game at the beginning of the game -- the menu will be
inactive during the game.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Statistics on
how well you have done at a particular game are available by
selecting <b>Statistics</b> from the Game menu. Only games
where you actually start moving cards are counted. The
statistics are here for your own enjoyment, there are
numerous ways to cheat and it is unwise to make
comparisons.</p>
