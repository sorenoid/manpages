<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tmpfiles.d
configuration files provide a generic mechanism to define
the <i>creation</i> of regular files, directories, pipes,
and device nodes, adjustments to their <i>access mode,
ownership, attributes, quota assignments, and contents</i>,
and finally their time-based <i>removal</i>. It is mostly
commonly used for volatile and temporary files and
directories (such as those located under /run/, /tmp/,
/var/tmp/, the API file systems such as /sys/ or /proc/, as
well as some other directories below /var/).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd-tmpfiles</b>
uses this configuration to create volatile files and
directories during boot and to do periodic cleanup
afterwards. See <a href="https://man.page/5/systemd-tmpfiles">systemd-tmpfiles(5)</a> for the
description of systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service,
systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service, and associated units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">System daemons
frequently require private runtime directories below /run/
to store communication sockets and similar. For these, it is
better to use <i>RuntimeDirectory=</i> in their unit files
(see <b>systemd.exec</b>(5) for details), if the flexibility
provided by tmpfiles.d is not required. The advantages are
that the configuration required by the unit is centralized
in one place, and that the lifetime of the directory is tied
to the lifetime of the service itself. Similarly,
<i>StateDirectory=</i>, <i>CacheDirectory=</i>,
<i>LogsDirectory=</i>, and <i>ConfigurationDirectory=</i>
should be used to create directories under /var/lib/,
/var/cache/, /var/log/, and /etc/. tmpfiles.d should be used
for files whose lifetime is independent of any service or
requires more complicated configuration.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
<a name="CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each
configuration file shall be named in the style of
<i>package</i>.conf or <i>package</i>-<i>part</i>.conf. The
second variant should be used when it is desirable to make
it easy to override just this part of configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files in
/etc/tmpfiles.d override files with the same name in
/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d and /run/tmpfiles.d. Files in
/run/tmpfiles.d override files with the same name in
/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d. Packages should install their
configuration files in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d. Files in
/etc/tmpfiles.d are reserved for the local administrator,
who may use this logic to override the configuration files
installed by vendor packages. All configuration files are
sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless
of which of the directories they reside in. If multiple
files specify the same path, the entry in the file with the
lexicographically earliest name will be applied (note that
lines suppressed due to the &quot;!&quot; are filtered
before application, meaning that if an early line carries
the exclamation mark and is suppressed because of that, a
later line matching in path will be applied). All other
conflicting entries will be logged as errors. When two lines
are prefix path and suffix path of each other, then the
prefix line is always created first, the suffix later (and
if removal applies to the line, the order is reversed: the
suffix is removed first, the prefix later). Lines that take
globs are applied after those accepting no globs. If
multiple operations shall be applied on the same file (such
as ACL, xattr, file attribute adjustments), these are always
done in the same fixed order. Except for those cases, the
files/directories are processed in the order they are
listed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied
by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null in /etc/tmpfiles.d/ bearing the same filename.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
<a name="CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
configuration format is one line per path, containing type,
path, mode, ownership, age, and argument fields. The lines
are separated by newlines, the fields by whitespace:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">#Type Path Mode
User Group Age Argument... <br>
d /run/user 0755 root root 10d - <br>
L /tmp/foobar - - - - /dev/null</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Fields may
contain C-style escapes. With the exception of the seventh
field (the &quot;argument&quot;) all fields may be enclosed
in quotes. Note that any whitespace found in the line after
the beginning of the argument field will be considered part
of the argument field. To begin the argument field with a
whitespace character, use C-style escapes (e.g.
&quot;\x20&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Type</b>
<br>
The type consists of a single letter and optionally an
exclamation mark (&quot;!&quot;) minus sign (&quot;-&quot;),
and/or equals sign (&quot;=&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
line types are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>f</i>,
<i>f+</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><i>f</i> will create a file if
it does not exist yet. If the argument parameter is given
and the file did not exist yet, it will be written to the
file. <i>f+</i> will create or truncate the file. If the
argument parameter is given, it will be written to the file.
Does not follow symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>w</i>,
<i>w+</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write the argument parameter to
a file, if the file exists. If suffixed with <i>+</i>, the
line will be appended to the file. If your configuration
writes multiple lines to the same file, use <i>w+</i>. Lines
of this type accept shell-style globs in place of normal
path names. The argument parameter will be written without a
trailing newline. C-style backslash escapes are interpreted.
Follows symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>d</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a directory. The mode
and ownership will be adjusted if specified. Contents of
this directory are subject to time based cleanup if the age
argument is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>D</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Similar to <i>d</i>, but in
addition the contents of the directory will be removed when
<b>--remove</b> is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>e</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Adjust the mode and ownership
of existing directories and remove their contents based on
age. Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in place of
normal path names. Contents of the directories are subject
to time based cleanup if the age argument is specified. If
the age argument is &quot;0&quot;, contents will be
unconditionally deleted every time <b>systemd-tmpfiles
--clean</b> is run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For this entry
to be useful, at least one of the mode, user, group, or age
arguments must be specified, since otherwise this entry has
no effect. As an exception, an entry with no effect may be
useful when combined with <i>!</i>, see the examples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>v</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a subvolume if the path
does not exist yet, the file system supports subvolumes
(btrfs), and the system itself is installed into a subvolume
(specifically: the root directory / is itself a subvolume).
Otherwise, create a normal directory, in the same way as
<i>d</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A subvolume
created with this line type is not assigned to any
higher-level quota group. For that, use <i>q</i> or
<i>Q</i>, which allow creating simple quota group
hierarchies, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>q</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a subvolume or directory
the same as <i>v</i>, but assign the subvolume to the same
higher-level quota groups as the parent. This ensures that
higher-level limits and accounting applied to the parent
subvolume also include the specified subvolume. On non-btrfs
file systems, this line type is identical to <i>d</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
subvolume already exists, no change to the quota hierarchy
is made, regardless of whether the subvolume is already
attached to a quota group or not. Also see <i>Q</i> below.
See <b>btrfs-qgroup</b>(8) for details about the btrfs quota
group concept.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Q</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create the subvolume or
directory the same as <i>v</i>, but assign the new subvolume
to a new leaf quota group. Instead of copying the
higher-level quota group assignments from the parent as is
done with <i>q</i>, the lowest quota group of the parent
subvolume is determined that is not the leaf quota group.
Then, an &quot;intermediary&quot; quota group is inserted
that is one level below this level, and shares the same ID
part as the specified subvolume. If no higher-level quota
group exists for the parent subvolume, a new quota group at
level 255 sharing the same ID as the specified subvolume is
inserted instead. This new intermediary quota group is then
assigned to the parent subvolume's higher-level quota
groups, and the specified subvolume's leaf quota group is
assigned to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Effectively,
this has a similar effect as <i>q</i>, however introduces a
new higher-level quota group for the specified subvolume
that may be used to enforce limits and accounting to the
specified subvolume and children subvolume created within
it. Thus, by creating subvolumes only via <i>q</i> and
<i>Q</i>, a concept of &quot;subtree quotas&quot; is
implemented. Each subvolume for which <i>Q</i> is set will
get a &quot;subtree&quot; quota group created, and all child
subvolumes created within it will be assigned to it. Each
subvolume for which <i>q</i> is set will not get such a
&quot;subtree&quot; quota group, but it is ensured that they
are added to the same &quot;subtree&quot; quota group as
their immediate parents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is
recommended to use <i>Q</i> for subvolumes that typically
contain further subvolumes, and where it is desirable to
have accounting and quota limits on all child subvolumes
together. Examples for <i>Q</i> are typically /home/ or
/var/lib/machines/. In contrast, <i>q</i> should be used for
subvolumes that either usually do not include further
subvolumes or where no accounting and quota limits are
needed that apply to all child subvolumes together. Examples
for <i>q</i> are typically /var/ or /var/tmp/.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As with
<i>q</i>, <i>Q</i> has no effect on the quota group
hierarchy if the subvolume already exists, regardless of
whether the subvolume already belong to a quota group or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>p</i>,
<i>p+</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a named pipe (FIFO) if
it does not exist yet. If suffixed with <i>+</i> and a file
already exists where the pipe is to be created, it will be
removed and be replaced by the pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>L</i>,
<i>L+</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a symlink if it does not
exist yet. If suffixed with <i>+</i> and a file or directory
already exists where the symlink is to be created, it will
be removed and be replaced by the symlink. If the argument
is omitted, symlinks to files with the same name residing in
the directory /usr/share/factory/ are created. Note that
permissions and ownership on symlinks are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>c</i>,
<i>c+</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a character device node
if it does not exist yet. If suffixed with <i>+</i> and a
file already exists where the device node is to be created,
it will be removed and be replaced by the device node. It is
recommended to suffix this entry with an exclamation mark to
only create static device nodes at boot, as udev will not
manage static device nodes that are created at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>b</i>,
<i>b+</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a block device node if
it does not exist yet. If suffixed with <i>+</i> and a file
already exists where the device node is to be created, it
will be removed and be replaced by the device node. It is
recommended to suffix this entry with an exclamation mark to
only create static device nodes at boot, as udev will not
manage static device nodes that are created at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>C</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Recursively copy a file or
directory, if the destination files or directories do not
exist yet or the destination directory is empty. Note that
this command will not descend into subdirectories if the
destination directory already exists and is not empty.
Instead, the entire copy operation is skipped. If the
argument is omitted, files from the source directory
/usr/share/factory/ with the same name are copied. Does not
follow symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>x</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore a path during cleaning.
Use this type to exclude paths from clean-up as controlled
with the Age parameter. Note that lines of this type do not
influence the effect of <i>r</i> or <i>R</i> lines. Lines of
this type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path
names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>X</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore a path during cleaning.
Use this type to exclude paths from clean-up as controlled
with the Age parameter. Unlike <i>x</i>, this parameter will
not exclude the content if path is a directory, but only
directory itself. Note that lines of this type do not
influence the effect of <i>r</i> or <i>R</i> lines. Lines of
this type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path
names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>r</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove a file or directory if
it exists. This may not be used to remove non-empty
directories, use <i>R</i> for that. Lines of this type
accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names. Does
not follow symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>R</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Recursively remove a path and
all its subdirectories (if it is a directory). Lines of this
type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names.
Does not follow symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>z</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Adjust the access mode, user
and group ownership, and restore the SELinux security
context of a file or directory, if it exists. Lines of this
type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names.
Does not follow symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Z</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Recursively set the access
mode, user and group ownership, and restore the SELinux
security context of a file or directory if it exists, as
well as of its subdirectories and the files contained
therein (if applicable). Lines of this type accept
shell-style globs in place of normal path names. Does not
follow symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>t</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set extended attributes, see
<a href="https://man.page/5/attr">attr(5)</a> for details. The argument field should take
one or more assignment expressions in the form
<i>namespace</i>.<i>attribute</i>=<i>value</i>, for examples
see below. Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in
place of normal path names. This can be useful for setting
SMACK labels. Does not follow symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that extended attributes settable with this line type are a
different concept from the Linux file attributes settable
with <i>h</i>/<i>H</i>, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>T</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as <i>t</i>, but operates
recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>h</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set Linux file/directory
attributes. Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in
place of normal path names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the argument field is <i>[+-=][aAcCdDeijPsStTu]</i>. The
prefix <i>+</i> (the default one) causes the attribute(s) to
be added; <i>-</i> causes the attribute(s) to be removed;
<i>=</i> causes the attributes to be set exactly as the
following letters. The letters &quot;aAcCdDeijPsStTu&quot;
select the new attributes for the files, see
<a href="https://man.page/1/chattr">chattr(1)</a> for further information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Passing only
<i>=</i> as argument resets all the file attributes listed
above. It has to be pointed out that the <i>=</i> prefix
limits itself to the attributes corresponding to the letters
listed here. All other attributes will be left untouched.
Does not follow symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that the Linux file attributes settable with this line type
are a different concept from the extended attributes
settable with <i>t</i>/<i>T</i>, see above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>H</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sames as <i>h</i>, but operates
recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>a</i>,
<i>a+</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set POSIX ACLs (access control
lists), see <a href="https://man.page/5/acl">acl(5)</a>. If suffixed with <i>+</i>, the
specified entries will be added to the existing set.
<b>systemd-tmpfiles</b> will automatically add the required
base entries for user and group based on the access mode of
the file, unless base entries already exist or are
explicitly specified. The mask will be added if not
specified explicitly or already present. Lines of this type
accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names. This
can be useful for allowing additional access to certain
files. Does not follow symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>A</i>,
<i>A+</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as <i>a</i> and <i>a+</i>,
but recursive. Does not follow symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
exclamation mark (&quot;!&quot;) is used, this line is only
safe to execute during boot, and can break a running system.
Lines without the exclamation mark are presumed to be safe
to execute at any time, e.g. on package upgrades.
<b>systemd-tmpfiles</b> will take lines with an exclamation
mark only into consideration, if the <b>--boot</b> option is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># Make sure
these are created by default so that nobody else can <br>
d /tmp/.X11-unix 1777 root root 10d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># Unlink the
X11 lock files <br>
r! /tmp/.X[0-9]*-lock</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second line
in contrast to the first one would break a running system,
and will only be executed with <b>--boot</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the minus
sign (&quot;-&quot;) is used, this line failing to run
successfully during create (and only create) will not cause
the execution of <b>systemd-tmpfiles</b> to return an
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># Modify sysfs
but don't fail if we are in a container with a read-only
/proc <br>
w- /proc/sys/vm/swappiness - - - - 10</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the equals
sign (&quot;=&quot;) is used, the file types of existing
objects in the specified path are checked, and removed if
they do not match. This includes any implicitly created
parent directories (which can be either directories or
directory symlinks). For example, if there is a FIFO in
place of one of the parent path components it will be
replaced with a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that for
all line types that result in creation of any kind of file
node (i.e. <i>f</i>/<i>F</i>,
<i>d</i>/<i>D</i>/<i>v</i>/<i>q</i>/<i>Q</i>, <i>p</i>,
<i>L</i>, <i>c</i>/<i>b</i> and <i>C</i>) leading
directories are implicitly created if needed, owned by root
with an access mode of 0755. In order to create them with
different modes or ownership make sure to add appropriate
<i>d</i> lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Path</b>
<br>
The file system path specification supports simple specifier
expansion, see below. The path (after expansion) must be
absolute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mode</b>
<br>
The file access mode to use when creating this file or
directory. If omitted or when set to &quot;-&quot;, the
default is used: 0755 for directories, 0644 for all other
file objects. For <i>z</i>, <i>Z</i> lines, if omitted or
when set to &quot;-&quot;, the file access mode will not be
modified. This parameter is ignored for <i>x</i>, <i>r</i>,
<i>R</i>, <i>L</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>a</i> lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Optionally, if
prefixed with &quot;~&quot;, the access mode is masked based
on the already set access bits for existing file or
directories: if the existing file has all executable bits
unset, all executable bits are removed from the new access
mode, too. Similarly, if all read bits are removed from the
old access mode, they will be removed from the new access
mode too, and if all write bits are removed, they will be
removed from the new access mode too. In addition, the
sticky/SUID/SGID bit is removed unless applied to a
directory. This functionality is particularly useful in
conjunction with <i>Z</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>User,
Group</b> <br>
The user and group to use for this file or directory. This
may either be a numeric ID or a user/group name. If omitted
or when set to &quot;-&quot;, the user and group of the user
who invokes <b>systemd-tmpfiles</b> is used. For <i>z</i>
and <i>Z</i> lines, when omitted or when set to
&quot;-&quot;, the file ownership will not be modified.
These parameters are ignored for <i>x</i>, <i>r</i>,
<i>R</i>, <i>L</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>a</i> lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This field
should generally only reference system users/groups, i.e.
users/groups that are guaranteed to be resolvable during
early boot. If this field references users/groups that only
become resolveable during later boot (i.e. after NIS, LDAP
or a similar networked directory service become available),
execution of the operations declared by the line will likely
fail. Also see <b><font color="#0000FF">Notes on
Resolvability of User and Group Names</font></b>

on system user/group definitions.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Age</b>
<br>
The date field, when set, is used to decide what files to
delete when cleaning. If a file or directory is older than
the current time minus the age field, it is deleted. The
field format is a series of integers each followed by one of
the following suffixes for the respective time units:
<b>s</b>, <b>m</b> or <b>min</b>, <b>h</b>, <b>d</b>,
<b>w</b>, <b>ms</b>, and <b>us</b>, meaning seconds,
minutes, hours, days, weeks, milliseconds, and microseconds,
respectively. Full names of the time units can be used
too.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
multiple integers and units are specified, the time values
are summed. If an integer is given without a unit, <b>s</b>
is assumed.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
the age is set to zero, the files are cleaned
unconditionally.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
age field only applies to lines starting with <i>d</i>,
<i>D</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>Q</i>, <i>C</i>,
<i>x</i> and <i>X</i>. If omitted or set to &quot;-&quot;,
no automatic clean-up is done.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
the age field starts with a tilde character &quot;~&quot;,
clean-up is only applied to files and directories one level
inside the directory specified, but not the files and
directories immediately inside it.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
age of a file system entry is determined from its last
modification timestamp (mtime), its last access timestamp
(atime), and (except for directories) its last status change
timestamp (ctime). By default, any of these three (or two)
values will prevent cleanup if it is more recent than the
current time minus the age field. To restrict the deletion
based on particular type of file timestamps, the age-by
argument can be used.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
age-by argument overrides the timestamp types to be used for
the age check. It can be specified by prefixing the age
argument with a sequence of characters to specify the
timestamp types and a colon (&quot;:&quot;):
&quot;<i>age-by</i>...:<i>cleanup-age</i>&quot;. The
argument can consist of <b>a</b> (<b>A</b> for directories),
<b>b</b> (<b>B</b> for directories), <b>c</b> (<b>C</b> for
directories), or <b>m</b> (<b>M</b> for directories). Those
respectively indicate access, creation, last status change,
and last modification time of a file system entry. The
lower-case letter signifies that the given timestamp type
should be considered for files, while the upper-case letter
signifies that the given timestamp type should be considered
for directories. See <a href="https://man.page/2/statx">statx(2)</a> file timestamp fields
for more details about timestamp types.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
not specified, the age-by field defaults to <b>abcmABM</b>,
i.e. by default all file timestamps are taken into
consideration, with the exception of the last status change
timestamp (ctime) for directories. This is because the aging
logic itself will alter the ctime whenever it deletes a file
inside it. To ensure that running the aging logic does not
feed back into the next iteration of itself, ctime for
directories is ignored by default.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">For
example:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">#
Files created and modified, and directories accessed more
than <br>
# an hour ago in &quot;/tmp/foo/bar&quot;, are subject to
time-based cleanup. <br>
d /tmp/foo/bar - - - - bmA:1h -</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that while the aging algorithm is run a 'shared' BSD file
lock (see <a href="https://man.page/2/flock">flock(2)</a>) is taken on each directory the
algorithm descends into (and each directory below that, and
so on). If the aging algorithm finds a lock is already taken
on some directory, it (and everything below it) is skipped.
Applications may use this to temporarily exclude certain
directory subtrees from the aging algorithm: the
applications can take a BSD file lock themselves, and as
long as they keep it aging of the directory and everything
below it is disabled.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Argument</b>
<br>
For <i>L</i> lines determines the destination path of the
symlink. For <i>c</i> and <i>b</i>, determines the
major/minor of the device node, with major and minor
formatted as integers, separated by &quot;:&quot;, e.g.
&quot;1:3&quot;. For <i>f</i>, <i>F</i>, and <i>w</i>, the
argument may be used to specify a short string that is
written to the file, suffixed by a newline. For <i>C</i>,
specifies the source file or directory. For <i>t</i> and
<i>T</i>, determines extended attributes to be set. For
<i>a</i> and <i>A</i>, determines ACL attributes to be set.
For <i>h</i> and <i>H</i>, determines the file attributes to
set. Ignored for all other lines.</font></p>
