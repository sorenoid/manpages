<p>SUDOERS_TIMESTAMP(5) BSD File Formats Manual
SUDOERS_TIMESTAMP(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>NAME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:6%;"><b>sudoers_timestamp</b> &mdash;
Sudoers Time Stamp Format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:6%;">The <b>sudoers</b> plugin uses
per-user time stamp files for credential caching. Once a
user has been authenticated, they may use <b>sudo</b>
without a password for a short period of time (</p>

<p>15 minutes unless overridden by the
<i>timestamp_timeout</i> option ). By default,
<b>sudoers</b> uses a separate record for each terminal,
which means that a user&rsquo;s login sessions are
authenticated separately. The <i>timestamp_type</i> option
can be used to select the type of time stamp record
<b>sudoers</b> will use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">A multi-record
time stamp file format was introduced in <b>sudo</b> 1.8.10
that uses a single file per user. Previously, a separate
file was used for each user and terminal combination unless
tty-based time stamps were disabled. The new format is
extensible and records of multiple types and versions may
coexist within the same file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">All records,
regardless of type or version, begin with a 16-bit version
number and a 16-bit record size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">Time stamp
records have the following structure:</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">/* Time stamp
entry types */ <br>
#define TS_GLOBAL 0x01 /* not restricted by tty or ppid */
<br>
#define TS_TTY 0x02 /* restricted by tty */ <br>
#define TS_PPID 0x03 /* restricted by ppid */ <br>
#define TS_LOCKEXCL 0x04 /* special lock record */</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">/* Time stamp
flags */ <br>
#define TS_DISABLED 0x01 /* entry disabled */ <br>
#define TS_ANYUID 0x02 /* ignore uid, only valid in key
*/</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">struct
timestamp_entry { <br>
unsigned short version; /* version number */ <br>
unsigned short size; /* entry size */ <br>
unsigned short type; /* TS_GLOBAL, TS_TTY, TS_PPID */ <br>
unsigned short flags; /* TS_DISABLED, TS_ANYUID */ <br>
uid_t auth_uid; /* uid to authenticate as */ <br>
pid_t sid; /* session ID associated with tty/ppid */ <br>
struct timespec start_time; /* session/ppid start time */
<br>
struct timespec ts; /* time stamp (CLOCK_MONOTONIC) */ <br>
union { <br>
dev_t ttydev; /* tty device number */ <br>
pid_t ppid; /* parent pid */ <br>
} u; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">The
timestamp_entry struct fields are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The version number of the
timestamp_entry struct. New entries are created with a
version number of 2. Records with different version numbers
may coexist in the same file but are not inter-operable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The size of the
record in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The record
type, currently TS_GLOBAL, TS_TTY, or TS_PPID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flags</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Zero or more record flags which
can be bit-wise ORed together. Supported flags are
TS_DISABLED, for records disabled via <b>sudo -k</b> and
TS_ANYUID, which is used only when matching records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth_uid</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The user-ID that was used for
authentication. Depending on the value of the <i>rootpw</i>,
<i>runaspw</i> and <i>targetpw</i> options, the user-ID may
be that of the invoking user, the root user, the default
runas user or the target user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sid</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The ID of the
user&rsquo;s terminal session, if present. The session ID is
only used when matching records of type TS_TTY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start_time</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The start time of the session
leader for records of type TS_TTY or of the parent process
for records of type TS_PPID. The <i>start_time</i> is used
to help prevent re-use of a time stamp record after a user
has logged out. Not all systems support a method to easily
retrieve a process&rsquo;s start time. The <i>start_time</i>
field was added in <b>sudoers</b> version 1.8.22 for the
second revision of the timestamp_entry struct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ts</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The actual time
stamp. A monotonic time source (which does not move
backward) is used if the system supports it. Where possible,
<b>sudoers</b> uses a monotonic timer that increments even
while the system is suspended. The value of <i>ts</i> is
updated each time a command is run via <b>sudo</b>. If the
difference between <i>ts</i> and the current time is less
than the value of the <i>timestamp_timeout</i> option, no
password is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u.ttydev</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The device number of the
terminal associated with the session for records of type
TS_TTY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u.ppid</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The ID of the parent process
for records of type TS_PPID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>LOCKING</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:6%;">In <b>sudoers</b> versions
1.8.10 through 1.8.14, the entire time stamp file was locked
for exclusive access when reading or writing to the file.
Starting in <b>sudoers</b> 1.8.15, individual records are
locked in the time stamp file instead of the entire file and
the lock is held for a longer period of time. This scheme is
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">The first record
in the time stamp file is of type TS_LOCKEXCL and is used as
a <i>lock</i> record to prevent more than one <b>sudo</b>
process from adding a new record at the same time. Once the
desired time stamp record has been located or created (and
locked), the TS_LOCKEXCL record is unlocked. The lock on the
individual time stamp record, however, is held until
authentication is complete. This allows <b>sudoers</b> to
avoid prompting for a password multiple times when it is
used more than once in a pipeline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">Records of type
TS_GLOBAL cannot be locked for a long period of time since
doing so would interfere with other <b>sudo</b> processes.
Instead, a separate lock record is used to prevent multiple
<b>sudo</b> processes using the same terminal (or parent
process ID) from prompting for a password as the same
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>HISTORY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:6%;">Originally, <b>sudo</b> used a
single zero-length file per user and the file&rsquo;s
modification time was used as the time stamp. Later versions
of <b>sudo</b> added restrictions on the ownership of the
time stamp files and directory as well as checks on the
validity of the time stamp itself. Notable changes were
introduced in the following <b>sudo</b> versions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.4.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Support for tty-based time
stamp file was added by appending the terminal name to the
time stamp file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.6.2</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The time stamp file was
replaced by a per-user directory which contained any
tty-based time stamp files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.6.3p2</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The target user name was added
to the time stamp file name when the <i>targetpw</i> option
was set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.7.3</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Information about the terminal
device was stored in tty-based time stamp files for validity
checks. This included the terminal device numbers, inode
number and, on systems where it was not updated when the
device was written to, the inode change time. This helped
prevent re-use of the time stamp file after logout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.8.6p7</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The terminal session ID was
added to tty-based time stamp files to prevent re-use of the
time stamp by the same user in a different terminal session.
It also helped prevent re-use of the time stamp file on
systems where the terminal device&rsquo;s inode change time
was updated by writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.8.10</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">A new, multi-record time stamp
file format was introduced that uses a single file per user.
The terminal device&rsquo;s change time was not included
since most systems now update the change time after a write
is performed as required by POSIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.8.15</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Individual records are locked
in the time stamp file instead of the entire file and the
lock is held until authentication is complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.8.22</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The start time of the terminal
session leader or parent process is now stored in non-global
time stamp records. This prevents re-use of the time stamp
file after logout in most cases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Support was
added for the kernel-based tty time stamps available in
OpenBSD which do not use an on-disk time stamp file.</p>
