<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">apt.conf -
Configuration file for APT</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/etc/apt/apt.conf
is the main configuration file shared by all the tools in
the APT suite of tools, though it is by no means the only
place options can be set. The suite also shares a common
command line parser to provide a uniform environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When an APT
tool starts up it will read the configuration files in the
following order:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. the file
specified by the <b>APT_CONFIG</b> environment variable (if
any)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. all files in
Dir::Etc::Parts in alphanumeric ascending order which have
either no or &quot;conf&quot; as filename extension and
which only contain alphanumeric, hyphen (-), underscore (_)
and period (.) characters. Otherwise APT will print a notice
that it has ignored a file, unless that file matches a
pattern in the Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently configuration list
- in which case it will be silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. the main
configuration file specified by Dir::Etc::main</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. all options
set in the binary specific configuration subtree are moved
into the root of the tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">5. the command
line options are applied to override the configuration
directives or to load even more configuration files.</p>

<h2>SYNTAX
<a name="SYNTAX"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
configuration file is organized in a tree with options
organized into functional groups. Option specification is
given with a double colon notation; for instance
APT::Get::Assume-Yes is an option within the APT tool group,
for the Get tool. Options do not inherit from their parent
groups.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Syntactically
the configuration language is modeled after what the ISC
tools such as bind and dhcp use. Lines starting with // are
treated as comments (ignored), as well as all text between
/* and */, just like C/C++ comments. Lines starting with #
are also treated as comments. Each line is of the form
APT::Get::Assume-Yes &quot;true&quot;;. The quotation marks
and trailing semicolon are required. The value must be on
one line, and there is no kind of string concatenation.
Values must not include backslashes or extra quotation
marks. Option names are made up of alphanumeric characters
and the characters &quot;/-:._+&quot;. A new scope can be
opened with curly braces, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">APT { <br>
Get { <br>
Assume-Yes &quot;true&quot;; <br>
Fix-Broken &quot;true&quot;; <br>
}; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">with newlines
placed to make it more readable. Lists can be created by
opening a scope and including a single string enclosed in
quotes followed by a semicolon. Multiple entries can be
included, separated by a semicolon.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs
{&quot;/usr/sbin/dpkg-preconfigure --apt&quot;;};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general the
sample configuration file
/usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index.gz is a good
guide for how it should look.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Case is not
significant in names of configuration items, so in the
previous example you could use dpkg::pre-install-pkgs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Names for the
configuration items are optional if a list is defined as can
be seen in the DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs example above. If you
don't specify a name a new entry will simply add a new
option to the list. If you specify a name you can override
the option in the same way as any other option by
reassigning a new value to the option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two special
commands are defined: #include (which is deprecated and not
supported by alternative implementations) and #clear.
#include will include the given file, unless the filename
ends in a slash, in which case the whole directory is
included. #clear is used to erase a part of the
configuration tree. The specified element and all its
descendants are erased. (Note that these lines also need to
end with a semicolon.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The #clear
command is the only way to delete a list or a complete
scope. Reopening a scope (or using the syntax described
below with an appended ::) will <i>not</i> override
previously written entries. Options can only be overridden
by addressing a new value to them - lists and scopes can't
be overridden, only cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of the APT
tools take an -o option which allows an arbitrary
configuration directive to be specified on the command line.
The syntax is a full option name (APT::Get::Assume-Yes for
instance) followed by an equals sign then the new value of
the option. To append a new element to a list, add a
trailing :: to the name of the list. (As you might suspect,
the scope syntax can't be used on the command line.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
appending items to a list using :: only works for one item
per line, and that you should not use it in combination with
the scope syntax (which adds :: implicitly). Using both
syntaxes together will trigger a bug which some users
unfortunately depend on: an option with the unusual name
&quot;::&quot; which acts like every other option with a
name. This introduces many problems; for one thing, users
who write multiple lines in this <i>wrong</i> syntax in the
hope of appending to a list will achieve the opposite, as
only the last assignment for this option &quot;::&quot; will
be used. Future versions of APT will raise errors and stop
working if they encounter this misuse, so please correct
such statements now while APT doesn't explicitly complain
about them.</p>

<h2>THE APT GROUP
<a name="THE APT GROUP"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This group of
options controls general APT behavior as well as holding the
options for all of the tools.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Architecture</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">System Architecture; sets the
architecture to use when fetching files and parsing package
lists. The internal default is the architecture apt was
compiled for.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Architectures</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All Architectures the system
supports. For instance, CPUs implementing the amd64 (also
called x86-64) instruction set are also able to execute
binaries compiled for the i386 (x86) instruction set. This
list is used when fetching files and parsing package lists.
The initial default is always the system's native
architecture (APT::Architecture), and foreign architectures
are added to the default list when they are registered via
<b>dpkg --add-architecture</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compressor</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This scope defines which
compression formats are supported, how compression and
decompression can be performed if support for this format
isn't built into apt directly and a cost-value indicating
how costly it is to compress something in this format. As an
example the following configuration stanza would allow apt
to download and uncompress as well as create and store files
with the low-cost .reversed file extension which it will
pass to the command <b>rev</b> without additional
commandline parameters for compression and
uncompression:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">APT::Compressor::rev
{</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Cost &quot;10&quot;;</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">};</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Build-Profiles</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List of all build profiles
enabled for build-dependency resolution, without the
&quot;profile.&quot; namespace prefix. By default this list
is empty. The <b>DEB_BUILD_PROFILES</b> as used by
<b>dpkg-buildpackage</b>(1) overrides the list notation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Default-Release</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Default release to install
packages from if more than one version is available.
Contains release name, codename or release version.
Examples: 'stable', 'testing', 'unstable', 'bullseye',
'bookworm', '4.0', '5.0*'. See also
<b>apt_preferences</b>(5).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Ignore-Hold</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore held packages; this
global option causes the problem resolver to ignore held
packages in its decision making.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Clean-Installed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defaults to on. When turned on
the autoclean feature will remove any packages which can no
longer be downloaded from the cache. If turned off then
packages that are locally installed are also excluded from
cleaning - but note that APT provides no direct means to
reinstall them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Immediate-Configure</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defaults to on, which will
cause APT to install essential and important packages as
soon as possible in an install/upgrade operation, in order
to limit the effect of a failing <b>dpkg</b>(1) call. If
this option is disabled, APT treats an important package in
the same way as an extra package: between the unpacking of
the package A and its configuration there can be many other
unpack or configuration calls for other unrelated packages
B, C etc. If these cause the <b>dpkg</b>(1) call to fail
(e.g. because package B's maintainer scripts generate an
error), this results in a system state in which package A is
unpacked but unconfigured - so any package depending on A is
now no longer guaranteed to work, as its dependency on A is
no longer satisfied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The immediate
configuration marker is also applied in the potentially
problematic case of circular dependencies, since a
dependency with the immediate flag is equivalent to a
Pre-Dependency. In theory this allows APT to recognise a
situation in which it is unable to perform immediate
configuration, abort, and suggest to the user that the
option should be temporarily deactivated in order to allow
the operation to proceed. Note the use of the word
&quot;theory&quot; here; in the real world this problem has
rarely been encountered, in non-stable distribution
versions, and was caused by wrong dependencies of the
package in question or by a system in an already broken
state; so you should not blindly disable this option, as the
scenario mentioned above is not the only problem it can help
to prevent in the first place.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Before a big
operation like dist-upgrade is run with this option disabled
you should try to explicitly install the package APT is
unable to configure immediately; but please make sure you
also report your problem to your distribution and to the APT
team with the bug link below, so they can work on improving
or correcting the upgrade process.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Force-LoopBreak</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Never enable this option unless
you <i>really</i> know what you are doing. It permits APT to
temporarily remove an essential package to break a
Conflicts/Conflicts or Conflicts/Pre-Depends loop between
two essential packages. <i>Such a loop should never exist
and is a grave bug</i>. This option will work if the
essential packages are not <b>tar</b>, <b>gzip</b>,
<b>libc</b>, <b>dpkg</b>, <b>dash</b> or anything that those
packages depend on.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Cache-Start</b>,
<b>Cache-Grow</b>, <b>Cache-Limit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">APT uses since version 0.7.26 a
resizable memory mapped cache file to store the available
information. Cache-Start acts as a hint of the size the
cache will grow to, and is therefore the amount of memory
APT will request at startup. The default value is 20971520
bytes (~20 MB). Note that this amount of space needs to be
available for APT; otherwise it will likely fail
ungracefully, so for memory restricted devices this value
should be lowered while on systems with a lot of configured
sources it should be increased. Cache-Grow defines in bytes
with the default of 1048576 (~1 MB) how much the cache size
will be increased in the event the space defined by
Cache-Start is not enough. This value will be applied again
and again until either the cache is big enough to store all
information or the size of the cache reaches the
Cache-Limit. The default of Cache-Limit is 0 which stands
for no limit. If Cache-Grow is set to 0 the automatic growth
of the cache is disabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Build-Essential</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines which packages are
considered essential build dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Get</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Get subsection controls the
<b>apt-get</b>(8) tool; please see its documentation for
more information about the options here.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Cache subsection controls
the <b>apt-cache</b>(8) tool; please see its documentation
for more information about the options here.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CDROM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The CDROM subsection controls
the <b>apt-cdrom</b>(8) tool; please see its documentation
for more information about the options here.</p>

<h2>THE ACQUIRE GROUP
<a name="THE ACQUIRE GROUP"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Acquire
group of options controls the download of packages as well
as the various &quot;acquire methods&quot; responsible for
the download itself (see also <b>sources.list</b>(5)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Check-Date</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Security related option
defaulting to true, enabling time-related checks. Disabling
it means that the machine's time cannot be trusted, and APT
will hence disable all time-related checks, such as
<b>Check-Valid-Until</b> and verifying that the Date field
of a release file is not in the future.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Max-FutureTime</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Maximum time (in seconds)
before its creation (as indicated by the Date header) that
the Release file should be considered valid. The default
value is 10. Archive specific settings can be made by
appending the label of the archive to the option name.
Preferably, the same can be achieved for specific
<b>sources.list</b>(5) entries by using the
<b>Date-Max-Future</b> option there.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Check-Valid-Until</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Security related option
defaulting to true, as giving a Release file's validation an
expiration date prevents replay attacks over a long
timescale, and can also for example help users to identify
mirrors that are no longer updated - but the feature depends
on the correctness of the clock on the user system. Archive
maintainers are encouraged to create Release files with the
Valid-Until header, but if they don't or a stricter value is
desired the Max-ValidTime option below can be used. The
<b>Check-Valid-Until</b> option of <b>sources.list</b>(5)
entries should be preferred to disable the check selectively
instead of using this global override.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Max-ValidTime</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Maximum time (in seconds) after
its creation (as indicated by the Date header) that the
Release file should be considered valid. If the Release file
itself includes a Valid-Until header the earlier date of the
two is used as the expiration date. The default value is 0
which stands for &quot;valid forever&quot;. Archive specific
settings can be made by appending the label of the archive
to the option name. Preferably, the same can be achieved for
specific <b>sources.list</b>(5) entries by using the
<b>Valid-Until-Max</b> option there.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Min-ValidTime</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Minimum time (in seconds) after
its creation (as indicated by the Date header) that the
Release file should be considered valid. Use this if you
need to use a seldom updated (local) mirror of a more
frequently updated archive with a Valid-Until header instead
of completely disabling the expiration date checking.
Archive specific settings can and should be used by
appending the label of the archive to the option name.
Preferably, the same can be achieved for specific
<b>sources.list</b>(5) entries by using the
<b>Valid-Until-Min</b> option there.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>AllowTLS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow use of the internal TLS
support in the http method. If set to false, this completely
disables support for TLS in apt's own methods (excluding the
curl-based https method). No TLS-related functions will be
called anymore.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PDiffs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Try to download deltas called
PDiffs for indexes (like Packages files) instead of
downloading whole ones. True by default. Preferably, this
can be set for specific <b>sources.list</b>(5) entries or
index files by using the <b>PDiffs</b> option there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Two sub-options
to limit the use of PDiffs are also available: FileLimit can
be used to specify a maximum number of PDiff files should be
downloaded to update a file. SizeLimit on the other hand is
the maximum percentage of the size of all patches compared
to the size of the targeted file. If one of these limits is
exceeded the complete file is downloaded instead of the
patches.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>By-Hash</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Try to download indexes via an
URI constructed from a hashsum of the expected file rather
than downloaded via a well-known stable filename. True by
default, but automatically disabled if the source indicates
no support for it. Usage can be forced with the special
value &quot;force&quot;. Preferably, this can be set for
specific <b>sources.list</b>(5) entries or index files by
using the <b>By-Hash</b> option there.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Queue-Mode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Queuing mode; Queue-Mode can be
one of host or access which determines how APT parallelizes
outgoing connections. host means that one connection per
target host will be opened, access means that one connection
per URI type will be opened.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Retries</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Number of retries to perform.
If this is non-zero APT will retry failed files the given
number of times.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Source-Symlinks</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use symlinks for source
archives. If set to true then source archives will be
symlinked when possible instead of copying. True is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>http
https</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The options in these scopes
configure APT's acquire transports for the protocols HTTP
and HTTPS and are documented in the
<b>apt-transport-http</b>(1) and
<b>apt-transport-https</b>(1) manpages respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ftp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">ftp::Proxy sets the default
proxy to use for FTP URIs. It is in the standard form of
ftp://[[user][:pass]@]host[:port]/. Per host proxies can
also be specified by using the form ftp::Proxy::&lt;host&gt;
with the special keyword DIRECT meaning to use no proxies.
If no one of the above settings is specified,
<b>ftp_proxy</b> environment variable will be used. To use
an FTP proxy you will have to set the ftp::ProxyLogin script
in the configuration file. This entry specifies the commands
to send to tell the proxy server what to connect to. Please
see /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index.gz for an
example of how to do this. The substitution variables
representing the corresponding URI component are
$(PROXY_USER), $(PROXY_PASS), $(SITE_USER), $(SITE_PASS),
$(SITE) and $(SITE_PORT).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The option
timeout sets the timeout timer used by the method; this
value applies to the connection as well as the data
timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Several
settings are provided to control passive mode. Generally it
is safe to leave passive mode on; it works in nearly every
environment. However, some situations require that passive
mode be disabled and port mode FTP used instead. This can be
done globally or for connections that go through a proxy or
for a specific host (see the sample config file for
examples).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to proxy FTP over HTTP by setting the <b>ftp_proxy</b>
environment variable to an HTTP URL - see the discussion of
the http method above for syntax. You cannot set this in the
configuration file and it is not recommended to use FTP over
HTTP due to its low efficiency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The setting
ForceExtended controls the use of RFC2428 EPSV and EPRT
commands. The default is false, which means these commands
are only used if the control connection is IPv6. Setting
this to true forces their use even on IPv4 connections. Note
that most FTP servers do not support RFC2428.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cdrom</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For URIs using the cdrom
method, the only configurable option is the mount point,
cdrom::Mount, which must be the mount point for the CD-ROM
(or DVD, or whatever) drive as specified in /etc/fstab. It
is possible to provide alternate mount and unmount commands
if your mount point cannot be listed in the fstab. The
syntax is to put</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">/cdrom/::Mount
&quot;foo&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">within the
cdrom block. It is important to have the trailing slash.
Unmount commands can be specified using UMount.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gpgv</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For GPGV URIs the only
configurable option is gpgv::Options, which passes
additional parameters to gpgv.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CompressionTypes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List of compression types which
are understood by the acquire methods. Files like Packages
can be available in various compression formats. By default
the acquire methods can decompress and recompress many
common formats like <b>xz</b> and <b>gzip</b>; with this
scope the supported formats can be queried, modified as well
as support for more formats added (see also
<b>APT::Compressor</b>). The syntax for this is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Acquire::CompressionTypes::<i>FileExtension</i>
&quot;<i>Methodname</i>&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also, the Order
subgroup can be used to define in which order the acquire
system will try to download the compressed files. The
acquire system will try the first and proceed with the next
compression type in this list on error, so to prefer one
over the other type simply add the preferred type first -
types not already added will be implicitly appended to the
end of the list, so e.g.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Acquire::CompressionTypes::Order::
&quot;gz&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">can be used to
prefer <b>gzip</b> compressed files over all other
compression formats. If <b>xz</b> should be preferred over
<b>gzip</b> and <b>bzip2</b> the configure setting should
look like this:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Acquire::CompressionTypes::Order
{ &quot;xz&quot;; &quot;gz&quot;; };</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
needed to add bz2 to the list explicitly as it will be added
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
Dir::Bin::<i>Methodname</i> will be checked at run time. If
this option has been set and support for this format isn't
directly built into apt, the method will only be used if
this file exists; e.g. for the bzip2 method (the inbuilt)
setting is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Dir::Bin::bzip2
&quot;/bin/bzip2&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note also that
list entries specified on the command line will be added at
the end of the list specified in the configuration files,
but before the default entries. To prefer a type in this
case over the ones specified in the configuration files you
can set the option direct - not in list style. This will not
override the defined list; it will only prefix the list with
this type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The special
type uncompressed can be used to give uncompressed files a
preference, but note that most archives don't provide
uncompressed files so this is mostly only usable for local
mirrors.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GzipIndexes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When downloading gzip
compressed indexes (Packages, Sources, or Translations),
keep them gzip compressed locally instead of unpacking them.
This saves quite a lot of disk space at the expense of more
CPU requirements when building the local package caches.
False by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Languages</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Languages subsection
controls which Translation files are downloaded and in which
order APT tries to display the description-translations. APT
will try to display the first available description in the
language which is listed first. Languages can be defined
with their short or long language codes. Note that not all
archives provide Translation files for every language - the
long language codes are especially rare.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
list includes &quot;environment&quot; and &quot;en&quot;.
&quot;environment&quot; has a special meaning here: it will
be replaced at runtime with the language codes extracted
from the LC_MESSAGES environment variable. It will also
ensure that these codes are not included twice in the list.
If LC_MESSAGES is set to &quot;C&quot; only the
Translation-en file (if available) will be used. To force
APT to use no Translation file use the setting
Acquire::Languages=none. &quot;none&quot; is another special
meaning code which will stop the search for a suitable
Translation file. This tells APT to download these
translations too, without actually using them unless the
environment specifies the languages. So the following
example configuration will result in the order &quot;en,
de&quot; in an English locale or &quot;de, en&quot; in a
German one. Note that &quot;fr&quot; is downloaded, but not
used unless APT is used in a French locale (where the order
would be &quot;fr, de, en&quot;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Acquire::Languages
{ &quot;environment&quot;; &quot;de&quot;; &quot;en&quot;;
&quot;none&quot;; &quot;fr&quot;; };</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note: To
prevent problems resulting from APT being executed in
different environments (e.g. by different users or by other
programs) all Translation files which are found in
/var/lib/apt/lists/ will be added to the end of the list
(after an implicit &quot;none&quot;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ForceIPv4</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When downloading, force to use
only the IPv4 protocol.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ForceIPv6</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When downloading, force to use
only the IPv6 protocol.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>MaxReleaseFileSize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The maximum file size of
Release/Release.gpg/InRelease files. The default is
10MB.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>EnableSrvRecords</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option controls if apt
will use the DNS SRV server record as specified in RFC 2782
to select an alternative server to connect to. The default
is &quot;true&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>AllowInsecureRepositories</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow update operations to load
data files from repositories without sufficient security
information. The default value is &quot;false&quot;.
Concept, implications as well as alternatives are detailed
in <b>apt-secure</b>(8).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>AllowWeakRepositories</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow update operations to load
data files from repositories which provide security
information, but these are deemed no longer
cryptographically strong enough. The default value is
&quot;false&quot;. Concept, implications as well as
alternatives are detailed in <b>apt-secure</b>(8).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>AllowDowngradeToInsecureRepositories</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow that a repository that
was previously gpg signed to become unsigned during an
update operation. When there is no valid signature for a
previously trusted repository apt will refuse the update.
This option can be used to override this protection. You
almost certainly never want to enable this. The default is
false. Concept, implications as well as alternatives are
detailed in <b>apt-secure</b>(8).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Changelogs::URI</b>
scope</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Acquiring changelogs can only
be done if an URI is known from where to get them.
Preferable the Release file indicates this in a 'Changelogs'
field. If this isn't available the Label/Origin field of the
Release file is used to check if a
Acquire::Changelogs::URI::Label::<i>LABEL</i> or
Acquire::Changelogs::URI::Origin::<i>ORIGIN</i> option
exists and if so this value is taken. The value in the
Release file can be overridden with
Acquire::Changelogs::URI::Override::Label::<i>LABEL</i> or
Acquire::Changelogs::URI::Override::Origin::<i>ORIGIN</i>.
The value should be a normal URI to a text file, except that
package specific data is replaced with the placeholder
@CHANGEPATH@. The value for it is: 1. if the package is from
a component (e.g. main) this is the first part otherwise it
is omitted, 2. the first letter of source package name,
except if the source package name starts with 'lib' in which
case it will be the first four letters. 3. The complete
source package name. 4. the complete name again and 5. the
source version. The first (if present), second, third and
fourth part are separated by a slash ('/') and between the
fourth and fifth part is an underscore ('_'). The special
value 'no' is available for this option indicating that this
source can't be used to acquire changelog files from.
Another source will be tried if available in this case.</p>

<h2>BINARY SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION
<a name="BINARY SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Especially with
the introduction of the <b>apt</b> binary it can be useful
to set certain options only for a specific binary as even
options which look like they would effect only a certain
binary like <b>APT::Get::Show-Versions</b> effect
<b>apt-get</b> as well as <b>apt</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Setting an
option for a specific binary only can be achieved by setting
the option inside the <b>Binary::</b><i>specific-binary</i>
scope. Setting the option <b>APT::Get::Show-Versions</b> for
the <b>apt</b> only can e.g. by done by setting
<b>Binary::apt::APT::Get::Show-Versions</b> instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that as
seen in the DESCRIPTION section further above you can't set
binary-specific options on the commandline itself nor in
configuration files loaded via the commandline.</p>

<h2>DIRECTORIES
<a name="DIRECTORIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Dir::State
section has directories that pertain to local state
information. lists is the directory to place downloaded
package lists in and status is the name of the
<b>dpkg</b>(1) status file. preferences is the name of the
APT preferences file. Dir::State contains the default
directory to prefix on all sub-items if they do not start
with / or ./.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Dir::Cache
contains locations pertaining to local cache information,
such as the two package caches srcpkgcache and pkgcache as
well as the location to place downloaded archives,
Dir::Cache::archives. Generation of caches can be turned off
by setting pkgcache or srcpkgcache to &quot;&quot;. This
will slow down startup but save disk space. It is probably
preferable to turn off the pkgcache rather than the
srcpkgcache. Like Dir::State the default directory is
contained in Dir::Cache</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Dir::Etc
contains the location of configuration files, sourcelist
gives the location of the sourcelist and main is the default
configuration file (setting has no effect, unless it is done
from the config file specified by <b>APT_CONFIG</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Dir::Parts
setting reads in all the config fragments in lexical order
from the directory specified. After this is done then the
main config file is loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Binary programs
are pointed to by Dir::Bin. Dir::Bin::Methods specifies the
location of the method handlers and gzip, bzip2, lzma, dpkg,
apt-get dpkg-source dpkg-buildpackage and apt-cache specify
the location of the respective programs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
configuration item RootDir has a special meaning. If set,
all paths will be relative to RootDir, <i>even paths that
are specified absolutely</i>. So, for instance, if RootDir
is set to /tmp/staging and Dir::State::status is set to
/var/lib/dpkg/status, then the status file will be looked up
in /tmp/staging/var/lib/dpkg/status. If you want to prefix
only relative paths, set Dir instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
Ignore-Files-Silently list can be used to specify which
files APT should silently ignore while parsing the files in
the fragment directories. Per default a file which ends with
.disabled, ~, .bak or .dpkg-[a-z]+ is silently ignored. As
seen in the last default value these patterns can use
regular expression syntax.</p>

<h2>APT IN DSELECT
<a name="APT IN DSELECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When APT is
used as a <b>dselect</b>(1) method several configuration
directives control the default behavior. These are in the
DSelect section.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Clean</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Cache Clean mode; this value
may be one of always, prompt, auto, pre-auto and never.
always and prompt will remove all packages from the cache
after upgrading, prompt (the default) does so conditionally.
auto removes only those packages which are no longer
downloadable (replaced with a new version for instance).
pre-auto performs this action before downloading new
packages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>options</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The contents of this variable
are passed to <b>apt-get</b>(8) as command line options when
it is run for the install phase.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Updateoptions</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The contents of this variable
are passed to <b>apt-get</b>(8) as command line options when
it is run for the update phase.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PromptAfterUpdate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If true the [U]pdate operation
in <b>dselect</b>(1) will always prompt to continue. The
default is to prompt only on error.</p>

<h2>HOW APT CALLS DPKG(1)
<a name="HOW APT CALLS DPKG(1)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several
configuration directives control how APT invokes
<b>dpkg</b>(1). These are in the DPkg section.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>options</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a list of options to
pass to <b>dpkg</b>(1). The options must be specified using
the list notation and each list item is passed as a single
argument to <b>dpkg</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Path</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a string that defines
the <b>PATH</b> environment variable used when running dpkg.
It may be set to any valid value of that environment
variable; or the empty string, in which case the variable is
not changed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pre-Invoke</b>,
<b>Post-Invoke</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a list of shell
commands to run before/after invoking <b>dpkg</b>(1). Like
options this must be specified in list notation. The
commands are invoked in order using /bin/sh; should any fail
APT will abort.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pre-Install-Pkgs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a list of shell
commands to run before invoking <b>dpkg</b>(1). Like options
this must be specified in list notation. The commands are
invoked in order using /bin/sh; should any fail APT will
abort. APT will pass the filenames of all .deb files it is
going to install to the commands, one per line on the
requested file descriptor, defaulting to standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Version 2 of
this protocol sends more information through the requested
file descriptor: a line with the text VERSION 2, the APT
configuration space, and a list of package actions with
filename and version information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Each
configuration directive line has the form key=value. Special
characters (equal signs, newlines, nonprintable characters,
quotation marks, and percent signs in key and newlines,
nonprintable characters, and percent signs in value) are
%-encoded. Lists are represented by multiple key::=value
lines with the same key. The configuration section ends with
a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Package action
lines consist of five fields in Version 2: package name
(without architecture qualification even if foreign), old
version, direction of version change (&lt; for upgrades,
&gt; for downgrades, = for no change), new version, action.
The version fields are &quot;-&quot; for no version at all
(for example when installing a package for the first time;
no version is treated as earlier than any real version, so
that is an upgrade, indicated as - &lt; 1.23.4). The action
field is &quot;**CONFIGURE**&quot; if the package is being
configured, &quot;**REMOVE**&quot; if it is being removed,
or the filename of a .deb file if it is being unpacked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In Version 3
after each version field follows the architecture of this
version, which is &quot;-&quot; if there is no version, and
a field showing the MultiArch type &quot;same&quot;,
&quot;foreign&quot;, &quot;allowed&quot; or
&quot;none&quot;. Note that &quot;none&quot; is an incorrect
typename which is just kept to remain compatible, it should
be read as &quot;no&quot; and users are encouraged to
support both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The version of
the protocol to be used for the command <i>cmd</i> can be
chosen by setting DPkg::Tools::options::<i>cmd</i>::Version
accordingly, the default being version 1. If APT isn't
supporting the requested version it will send the
information in the highest version it has support for
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The file
descriptor to be used to send the information can be
requested with DPkg::Tools::options::<i>cmd</i>::InfoFD
which defaults to 0 for standard input and is available
since version 0.9.11. Support for the option can be detected
by looking for the environment variable
<b>APT_HOOK_INFO_FD</b> which contains the number of the
used file descriptor as a confirmation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Run-Directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">APT chdirs to this directory
before invoking <b>dpkg</b>(1), the default is /.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Build-options</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These options are passed to
<b>dpkg-buildpackage</b>(1) when compiling packages; the
default is to disable signing and produce all binaries.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>DPkg::ConfigurePending</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this option is set APT will
call <b>dpkg --configure --pending</b> to let <b>dpkg</b>(1)
handle all required configurations and triggers. This option
is activated by default, but deactivating it could be useful
if you want to run APT multiple times in a row - e.g. in an
installer. In this scenario you could deactivate this option
in all but the last run.</p>

<h2>PERIODIC AND ARCHIVES OPTIONS
<a name="PERIODIC AND ARCHIVES OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">APT::Periodic
and APT::Archives groups of options configure behavior of
apt periodic updates, which is done by the
/usr/lib/apt/apt.systemd.daily script. See the top of this
script for the brief documentation of these options.</p>

<h2>DEBUG OPTIONS
<a name="DEBUG OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Enabling
options in the Debug:: section will cause debugging
information to be sent to the standard error stream of the
program utilizing the apt libraries, or enable special
program modes that are primarily useful for debugging the
behavior of apt. Most of these options are not interesting
to a normal user, but a few may be:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Debug::pkgProblemResolver enables output about the decisions
made by dist-upgrade, upgrade, install, remove, purge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Debug::NoLocking disables all file locking. This can be used
to run some operations (for instance, apt-get -s install) as
a non-root user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Debug::pkgDPkgPM prints out the actual command line each
time that apt invokes <b>dpkg</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Debug::IdentCdrom disables the inclusion of statfs data in
CD-ROM IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A full list of

Debug::pkgProblemResolver for that.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Debug::pkgDepCache::Marker</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generate debug messages
