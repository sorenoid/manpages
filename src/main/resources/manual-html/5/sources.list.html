<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sources.list -
List of configured APT data sources</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The source list
/etc/apt/sources.list and the files contained in
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ are designed to support any number
of active sources and a variety of source media. The files
list one source per line (one-line style) or contain
multiline stanzas defining one or more sources per stanza
(deb822 style), with the most preferred source listed first
(in case a single version is available from more than one
source). The information available from the configured
sources is acquired by <b>apt-get update</b> (or by an
equivalent command from another APT front-end).</p>

<h2>SOURCES.LIST.D
<a name="SOURCES.LIST.D"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
/etc/apt/sources.list.d directory provides a way to add
sources.list entries in separate files. Two different file
formats are allowed as described in the next two sections.
Filenames need to have either the extension .list or
.sources depending on the contained format. The filenames
may only contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9),
underscore (_), hyphen (-) and period (.) characters.
Otherwise APT will print a notice that it has ignored a
file, unless that file matches a pattern in the
Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently configuration list - in which
case it will be silently ignored.</p>

<h2>ONE-LINE-STYLE FORMAT
<a name="ONE-LINE-STYLE FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files in this
format have the extension .list. Each line specifying a
source starts with a type (e.g. deb-src) followed by options
and arguments for this type. Individual entries cannot be
continued onto a following line. Empty lines are ignored,
and a # character anywhere on a line marks the remainder of
that line as a comment. Consequently an entry can be
disabled by commenting out the entire line. If options
should be provided they are separated by spaces and all of
them together are enclosed by square brackets ([]) included
in the line after the type separated from it with a space.
If an option allows multiple values these are separated from
each other with a comma (,). An option name is separated
from its value(s) by an equals sign (=). Multivalue options
also have -= and += as separators, which instead of
replacing the default with the given value(s) modify the
default value(s) to remove or include the given values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
traditional format and supported by all apt versions. Note
that not all options as described below are supported by all
apt versions. Note also that some older applications parsing
this format on their own might not expect to encounter
options as they were uncommon before the introduction of
multi-architecture support.</p>

<h2>DEB822-STYLE FORMAT
<a name="DEB822-STYLE FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files in this
format have the extension .sources. The format is similar in
syntax to other files used by Debian and its derivatives,
such as the metadata files that apt will download from the
configured sources or the debian/control file in a Debian
source package. Individual entries are separated by an empty
line; additional empty lines are ignored, and a # character
at the start of the line marks the entire line as a comment.
An entry can hence be disabled by commenting out each line
belonging to the stanza, but it is usually easier to add the
field &quot;Enabled: no&quot; to the stanza to disable the
entry. Removing the field or setting it to yes re-enables
it. Options have the same syntax as every other field: A
field name separated by a colon (:) and optionally spaces
from its value(s). Note especially that multiple values are
separated by whitespaces (like spaces, tabs and newlines),
not by commas as in the one-line format. Multivalue fields
like Architectures also have Architectures-Add and
Architectures-Remove to modify the default value rather than
replacing it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a new
format supported by apt itself since version 1.1. Previous
versions ignore such files with a notice message as
described earlier. It is intended to make this format
gradually the default format, deprecating the previously
described one-line-style format, as it is easier to create,
extend and modify for humans and machines alike especially
if a lot of sources and/or options are involved. Developers
who are working with and/or parsing apt sources are highly
encouraged to add support for this format and to contact the
APT team to coordinate and share this work. Users can freely
adopt this format already, but may encounter problems with
software not supporting the format yet.</p>

<h2>THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES: GENERAL FORMAT
<a name="THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES: GENERAL FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The deb type
references a typical two-level Debian archive,
distribution/component. The distribution is generally a
suite name like stable or testing or a codename like
bullseye or bookworm while component is one of main, contrib
or non-free. The deb-src type references a Debian
distribution's source code in the same form as the deb type.
A deb-src line is required to fetch source indexes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format for
two one-line-style entries using the deb and deb-src types
is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">deb [
option1=value1 option2=value2 ] uri suite [component1]
[component2] [...] <br>
deb-src [ option1=value1 option2=value2 ] uri suite
[component1] [component2] [...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively
the equivalent entry in deb822 style looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Types: deb
deb-src <br>
URIs: uri <br>
Suites: suite <br>
Components: [component1] [component2] [...] <br>
option1: value1 <br>
option2: value2</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The URI for the
deb type must specify the base of the Debian distribution,
from which APT will find the information it needs. suite can
specify an exact path, in which case the components must be
omitted and suite must end with a slash (/). This is useful
for the case when only a particular sub-directory of the
archive denoted by the URI is of interest. If suite does not
specify an exact path, at least one component must be
present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">suite may also
contain a variable, $(ARCH) which expands to the Debian
architecture (such as amd64 or armel) used on the system.
This permits architecture-independent sources.list files to
be used. In general this is only of interest when specifying
an exact path; APT will automatically generate a URI with
the current architecture otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Especially in
the one-line-style format since only one distribution can be
specified per line it may be necessary to have multiple
lines for the same URI, if a subset of all available
distributions or components at that location is desired. APT
will sort the URI list after it has generated a complete set
internally, and will collapse multiple references to the
same Internet host, for instance, into a single connection,
so that it does not inefficiently establish a connection,
close it, do something else, and then re-establish a
connection to that same host. APT also parallelizes
connections to different hosts to more effectively deal with
sites with low bandwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is important
to list sources in order of preference, with the most
preferred source listed first. Typically this will result in
sorting by speed from fastest to slowest (CD-ROM followed by
hosts on a local network, followed by distant Internet
hosts, for example).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an example,
the sources for your distribution could look like this in
one-line-style format:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">deb
http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hirsute main restricted
<br>
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hirsute-security main
restricted <br>
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hirsute-updates main
restricted</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or like this in
deb822 style format:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Types: deb <br>
URIs: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu <br>
Suites: hirsute hirsute-updates <br>
Components: main restricted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Types: deb <br>
URIs: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu <br>
Suites: hirsute-security <br>
Components: main restricted</p>

<h2>THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES: OPTIONS
<a name="THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES: OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each source
entry can have options specified to modify which source is
accessed and how data is acquired from it. Format, syntax
and names of the options vary between the one-line-style and
deb822-style formats as described, but they both have the
same options available. For simplicity we list the deb822
field name and provide the one-line name in brackets.
Remember that besides setting multivalue options explicitly,
there is also the option to modify them based on the
default, but we aren't listing those names explicitly here.
Unsupported options are silently ignored by all APT
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Architectures</b> (<b>arch</b>) is a multivalue option
defining for which architectures information should be
downloaded. If this option isn't set the default is all
architectures as defined by the <b>APT::Architectures</b>
config option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Languages</b> (<b>lang</b>) is a multivalue option
defining for which languages information such as translated
package descriptions should be downloaded. If this option
isn't set the default is all languages as defined by the
<b>Acquire::Languages</b> config option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Targets</b> (<b>target</b>) is a multivalue option
defining which download targets apt will try to acquire from
this source. If not specified, the default set is defined by
the <b>Acquire::IndexTargets</b> configuration scope
(targets are specified by their name in the Created-By
field). Additionally, targets can be enabled or disabled by
using the Identifier field as an option with a boolean value
instead of using this multivalue option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>PDiffs</b> (<b>pdiffs</b>) is a yes/no value which
controls if APT should try to use PDiffs to update old
indexes instead of downloading the new indexes entirely. The
value of this option is ignored if the repository doesn't
announce the availability of PDiffs. Defaults to the value
of the option with the same name for a specific index file
defined in the <b>Acquire::IndexTargets</b> scope, which
itself defaults to the value of configuration option
<b>Acquire::PDiffs</b> which defaults to yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>By-Hash</b> (<b>by-hash</b>) can have the value yes, no
or force and controls if APT should try to acquire indexes
via a URI constructed from a hashsum of the expected file
instead of using the well-known stable filename of the
index. Using this can avoid hashsum mismatches, but requires
a supporting mirror. A yes or no value activates/disables
the use of this feature if this source indicates support for
it, while force will enable the feature regardless of what
the source indicates. Defaults to the value of the option of
the same name for a specific index file defined in the
<b>Acquire::IndexTargets</b> scope, which itself defaults to
the value of configuration option <b>Acquire::By-Hash</b>
which defaults to yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore,
there are options which if set affect <i>all</i> sources
with the same URI and Suite, so they have to be set on all
such entries and can not be varied between different
components. APT will try to detect and error out on such
anomalies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Allow-Insecure</b> (<b>allow-insecure</b>),
<b>Allow-Weak</b> (<b>allow-weak</b>) and
<b>Allow-Downgrade-To-Insecure</b>
(<b>allow-downgrade-to-insecure</b>) are boolean values
which all default to no. If set to yes they circumvent parts
of <b>apt-secure</b>(8) and should therefore not be used
lightly!</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Trusted</b> (<b>trusted</b>) is a tri-state value which
defaults to APT deciding if a source is considered trusted
or if warnings should be raised before e.g. packages are
installed from this source. This option can be used to
override that decision. The value yes tells APT always to
consider this source as trusted, even if it doesn't pass
authentication checks. It disables parts of
<b>apt-secure</b>(8), and should therefore only be used in a
local and trusted context (if at all) as otherwise security
is breached. The value no does the opposite, causing the
source to be handled as untrusted even if the authentication
checks passed successfully. The default value can't be set
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Signed-By</b> (<b>signed-by</b>) is an option to require
a repository to pass <b>apt-secure</b>(8) verification with
a certain set of keys rather than all trusted keys apt has
configured. It is specified as a list of absolute paths to
keyring files (have to be accessible and readable for the
_apt system user, so ensure everyone has read-permissions on
the file) and fingerprints of keys to select from these
keyrings. The recommended locations for keyrings are
/usr/share/keyrings for keyrings managed by packages, and
/etc/apt/keyrings for keyrings managed by the system
operator. If no keyring files are specified the default is
the trusted.gpg keyring and all keyrings in the
trusted.gpg.d/ directory (see <b>apt-key fingerprint</b>).
If no fingerprint is specified all keys in the keyrings are
selected. A fingerprint will accept also all signatures by a
subkey of this key, if this isn't desired an exclamation
mark (!) can be appended to the fingerprint to disable this
behaviour. The option defaults to the value of the option
with the same name if set in the previously acquired Release
file of this repository (only fingerprints can be specified
there through). Otherwise all keys in the trusted keyrings
are considered valid signers for this repository. The option
may also be set directly to an embedded GPG public key
block. Special care is needed to encode the empty line with
leading spaces and &quot;.&quot;:</p>

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Check-Valid-Until</b> (<b>check-valid-until</b>) is a
yes/no value which controls if APT should try to detect
replay attacks. A repository creator can declare a time
until which the data provided in the repository should be
considered valid, and if this time is reached, but no new
data is provided, the data is considered expired and an
error is raised. Besides increasing security, as a malicious
attacker can't send old data forever to prevent a user from
upgrading to a new version, this also helps users identify
mirrors which are no longer updated. However, some
repositories such as historic archives are not updated any
more by design, so this check can be disabled by setting
this option to no. Defaults to the value of configuration
option <b>Acquire::Check-Valid-Until</b> which itself
defaults to yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Valid-Until-Min</b> (<b>valid-until-min</b>) and
<b>Valid-Until-Max</b> (<b>valid-until-max</b>) can be used
to raise or lower the time period in seconds in which the
data from this repository is considered valid. -Max can be
especially useful if the repository provides no Valid-Until
field on its Release file to set your own value, while -Min
can be used to increase the valid time on seldom updated
(local) mirrors of a more frequently updated but less
accessible archive (which is in the sources.list as well)
instead of disabling the check entirely. Default to the
value of the configuration options
<b>Acquire::Min-ValidTime</b> and
<b>Acquire::Max-ValidTime</b> which are both unset by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Check-Date</b> (<b>check-date</b>) is a yes/no value
which controls if APT should consider the machine's time
correct and hence perform time related checks, such as
verifying that a Release file is not from the future.
Disabling it also disables the <b>Check-Valid-Until</b>
option mentioned above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Date-Max-Future</b> (<b>date-max-future</b>) controls how
far from the future a repository may be. Default to the
value of the configuration option
<b>Acquire::Max-FutureTime</b> which is 10 seconds by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>InRelease-Path</b> (<b>inrelease-path</b>) determines the
path to the InRelease file, relative to the normal position
of an InRelease file. By default, this option is unset and
APT will try to fetch an InRelease or, if that fails, a
Release file and its associated Release.gpg file. By setting
this option, the specified path will be tried instead of the
InRelease file, and the fallback to Release files will be
disabled.</p>

<h2>URI SPECIFICATION
<a name="URI SPECIFICATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The currently
recognized URI types are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>http</b>
(<b>apt-transport-http</b>(1))</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The http scheme specifies an
HTTP server for an archive and is the most commonly used
method. The URI can directly include login information if
the archive requires it, but the use of
<b>apt_auth.conf</b>(5) should be preferred. The method also
supports SOCKS5 and HTTP(S) proxies either configured via
apt-specific configuration or specified by the environment
variable <b>http_proxy</b> in the format (assuming an HTTP
proxy requiring authentication)
<i>http://user:pass@server:port/</i>. The authentication
details for proxies can also be supplied via
<b>apt_auth.conf</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that these
forms of authentication are insecure as the whole
communication with the remote server (or proxy) is not
encrypted so a sufficiently capable attacker can observe and
record login as well as all other interactions. The attacker
can <i>not</i> modify the communication through as APT's
data security model is independent of the chosen transport
method. See <b>apt-secure</b>(8) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>https</b>
(<b>apt-transport-https</b>(1))</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The https scheme specifies an
HTTPS server for an archive and is very similar in use and
available options to the http scheme. The main difference is
that the communication between apt and server (or proxy) is
encrypted. Note that the encryption does not prevent an
attacker from knowing which server (or proxy) apt is
communicating with and deeper analysis can potentially still
reveal which data was downloaded. If this is a concern the
Tor-based schemes mentioned further below might be a
suitable alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mirror</b>,
<b>mirror+</b><i>scheme</i>
(<b>apt-transport-mirror</b>(1))</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The mirror scheme specifies the
location of a mirrorlist. By default the scheme used for the
location is http, but any other scheme can be used via
<b>mirror+</b><i>scheme</i>. The mirrorlist itself can
contain many different URIs for mirrors the APT client can
transparently pick, choose and fallback between intended to
help both with distributing the load over the available
mirrors and ensuring that clients can acquire data even if
some configured mirrors are not available.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The file scheme allows an
arbitrary directory in the file system to be considered an
archive. This is useful for NFS mounts and local mirrors or
archives.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cdrom</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The cdrom scheme allows APT to
use a local CD-ROM, DVD or USB drive with media swapping.
Use the <b>apt-cdrom</b>(8) program to create cdrom entries
in the source list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ftp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The ftp scheme specifies an FTP
server for an archive. Use of FTP is on the decline in
favour of http and https and many archives either never
offered or are retiring FTP access. If you still need this
method many configuration options for it are available in
the Acquire::ftp scope and detailed in
<b>apt.conf</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that an FTP proxy can be specified by using the
<b>ftp_proxy</b> environment variable. It is possible to
specify an HTTP proxy (HTTP proxy servers often understand
FTP URLs) using this environment variable and <i>only</i>
this environment variable. Proxies using HTTP specified in
the configuration file will be ignored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>copy</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The copy scheme is identical to
the file scheme except that packages are copied into the
cache directory instead of used directly at their location.
This is useful for people using removable media to copy
files around with APT.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rsh</b>,
<b>ssh</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The rsh/ssh method invokes
RSH/SSH to connect to a remote host and access the files as
a given user. Prior configuration of rhosts or RSA keys is
recommended. The standard <b>find</b> and <b>dd</b> commands
are used to perform the file transfers from the remote
host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">adding more
recognizable URI types</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">APT can be extended with more
methods shipped in other optional packages, which should
follow the naming scheme apt-transport-<i>method</i>. For
instance, the APT team also maintains the package
apt-transport-tor, which provides access methods for HTTP
and HTTPS URIs routed via the Tor network.</p>
