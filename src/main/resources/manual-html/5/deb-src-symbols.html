<b>debian/symbols.</b><i>arch</i>,
<b>debian/</b><i>package</i><b>.symbols</b>,
<b>debian/symbols</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The symbol file
templates are shipped in Debian source packages, and its
format is a superset of the symbols files shipped in binary
packages, see <a href="https://man.page/5/deb-symbols">deb-symbols(5)</a>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Comments</b>
<br>
Comments are supported in template symbol files. Any line
with &rsquo;#&rsquo; as the first character is a comment
except if it starts with &rsquo;#include&rsquo; (see section
<b>Using includes</b>). Lines starting with
&rsquo;#MISSING:&rsquo; are special comments documenting
symbols that have disappeared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
#PACKAGE# substitution</b> <br>
In some rare cases, the name of the library varies between
architectures. To avoid hardcoding the name of the package
in the symbols file, you can use the marker
<i>#PACKAGE#</i>. It will be replaced by the real package
name during installation of the symbols files. Contrary to
the <i>#MINVER#</i> marker, <i>#PACKAGE#</i> will never
appear in a symbols file inside a binary package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using symbol
tags</b> <br>
Symbol tagging is useful for marking symbols that are
special in some way. Any symbol can have an arbitrary number
of tags associated with it. While all tags are parsed and
stored, only some of them are understood by
<b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> and trigger special handling of the
symbols. See subsection <b>Standard symbol tags</b> for
reference of these tags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tag
specification comes right before the symbol name (no
whitespace is allowed in between). It always starts with an
opening bracket <b>(</b>, ends with a closing bracket
<b>)</b> and must contain at least one tag. Multiple tags
are separated by the <b>|</b> character. Each tag can
optionally have a value which is separated form the tag name
by the <b>=</b> character. Tag names and values can be
arbitrary strings except they cannot contain any of the
special <b>) | =</b> characters. Symbol names following a
tag specification can optionally be quoted with either
<b>&rsquo;</b> or <b>&quot;</b> characters to allow
whitespaces in them. However, if there are no tags specified
for the symbol, quotes are treated as part of the symbol
name which continues up until the first space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(tag1=i am
marked|tag name with space)&quot;tagged quoted
symbol&quot;@Base 1.0 <br>
(optional)tagged_unquoted_symbol@Base 1.0 1 <br>
untagged_symbol@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
symbol in the example is named <i>tagged quoted symbol</i>
and has two tags: <i>tag1</i> with value <i>i am marked</i>
and <i>tag name with space</i> that has no value. The second
symbol named <i>tagged_unquoted_symbol</i> is only tagged
with the tag named <i>optional</i>. The last symbol is an
example of the normal untagged symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since symbol
tags are an extension of the <a href="https://man.page/5/deb-symbols">deb-symbols(5)</a> format,
they can only be part of the symbols files used in source
packages (those files should then be seen as templates used
to build the symbols files that are embedded in binary
packages). When <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> is called without the
<b>-t</b> option, it will output symbols files compatible to
the <a href="https://man.page/5/deb-symbols">deb-symbols(5)</a> format: it fully processes symbols
according to the requirements of their standard tags and
strips all tags from the output. On the contrary, in
template mode (<b>-t</b>) all symbols and their tags (both
standard and unknown ones) are kept in the output and are
written in their original form as they were loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Standard
symbol tags <br>
optional</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A symbol marked as optional can
disappear from the library at any time and that will never
cause <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> to fail. However, disappeared
optional symbols will continuously appear as
<small>MISSING</small> in the diff in each new package
revision. This behaviour serves as a reminder for the
maintainer that such a symbol needs to be removed from the
symbol file or readded to the library. When the optional
symbol, which was previously declared as
<small>MISSING,</small> suddenly reappears in the next
revision, it will be upgraded back to the
&ldquo;existing&rdquo; status with its minimum version
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This tag is
useful for symbols which are private where their
disappearance do not cause <small>ABI</small> breakage. For
example, most of C <small>++</small> template instantiations
fall into this category. Like any other tag, this one may
also have an arbitrary value: it could be used to indicate
why the symbol is considered optional.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>arch=</b><i>architecture-list</i>
<b><br>
arch-bits=</b><i>architecture-bits</i> <b><br>
arch-endian=</b><i>architecture-endianness</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These tags allow one to
restrict the set of architectures where the symbol is
supposed to exist. The <b>arch-bits</b> and
<b>arch-endian</b> tags are supported since dpkg 1.18.0.
When the symbols list is updated with the symbols discovered
in the library, all arch-specific symbols which do not
concern the current host architecture are treated as if they
did not exist. If an arch-specific symbol matching the
current host architecture does not exist in the library,
normal procedures for missing symbols apply and it may cause
<b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> to fail. On the other hand, if the
arch-specific symbol is found when it was not supposed to
exist (because the current host architecture is not listed
in the tag or does not match the endianness and bits), it is
made arch neutral (i.e. the arch, arch-bits and arch-endian
tags are dropped and the symbol will appear in the diff due
to this change), but it is not considered as new.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When operating
in the default non-template mode, among arch-specific
symbols only those that match the current host architecture
are written to the symbols file. On the contrary, all
arch-specific symbols (including those from foreign arches)
are always written to the symbol file when operating in
template mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
<i>architecture-list</i> is the same as the one used in the
<b>Build-Depends</b> field of <i>debian/control</i> (except
the enclosing square brackets []). For example, the first
symbol from the list below will be considered only on alpha,
any-amd64 and ia64 architectures, the second only on linux
architectures, while the third one anywhere except on
armel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(arch=alpha
any-amd64 ia64)64bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0 <br>
(arch=linux-any)linux_specific_symbol@Base 1.0 <br>
(arch=!armel)symbol_armel_does_not_have@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>architecture-bits</i> is either <b>32</b> or
<b>64</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(arch-bits=32)32bit_specific_symbol@Base
1.0 <br>
(arch-bits=64)64bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>allow-internal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">dpkg-gensymbols has a list of
internal symbols that should not appear in symbols files as
they are usually only side-effects of implementation details
of the toolchain (since dpkg 1.20.1). If for some reason,
you really want one of those symbols to be included in the
symbols file, you should tag the symbol with
<b>allow-internal</b>. It can be necessary for some low
level toolchain libraries like &ldquo;libgcc&rdquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ignore-blacklist</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A deprecated alias for
<b>allow-internal</b> (since dpkg 1.20.1, supported since
dpkg 1.15.3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>regex</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Denotes <i>regex</i> symbol
pattern. See <b>Using symbol patterns</b> subsection
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using symbol
patterns</b> <br>
Unlike a standard symbol specification, a pattern may cover
multiple real symbols from the library.
<b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> will attempt to match each pattern
against each real symbol that does <i>not</i> have a
specific symbol counterpart defined in the symbol file.
Whenever the first matching pattern is found, all its tags
and properties will be used as a basis specification of the
symbol. If none of the patterns matches, the symbol will be
considered as new.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A pattern is
considered lost if it does not match any symbol in the
library. By default this will trigger a
<b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> failure under <b>-c1</b> or higher
level. However, if the failure is undesired, the pattern may
be marked with the <i>optional</i> tag. Then if the pattern
does not match anything, it will only appear in the diff as
<small>MISSING.</small> Moreover, like any symbol, the
pattern may be limited to the specific architectures with
the <i>arch</i> tag. Please refer to <b>Standard symbol
tags</b> subsection above for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Patterns are an
extension of the <a href="https://man.page/5/deb-symbols">deb-symbols(5)</a> format hence they are
only valid in symbol file templates. Pattern specification
syntax is not any different from the one of a specific
symbol. However, symbol name part of the specification
serves as an expression to be matched against
<i>name@version</i> of the real symbol. In order to
distinguish among different pattern types, a pattern will
typically be tagged with a special tag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the moment,
<b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> supports three basic pattern
types:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<p><b>c++</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>This pattern is denoted by the <i>c++</i> tag. It
matches only C <small>++</small> symbols by their demangled
symbol name (as emitted by <b>c++filt</b>(1) utility). This
pattern is very handy for matching symbols which mangled
names might vary across different architectures while their
demangled names remain the same. One group of such symbols
is <i>non-virtual thunks</i> which have architecture
specific offsets embedded in their mangled names. A common
instance of this case is a virtual destructor which under
diamond inheritance needs a non-virtual thunk symbol. For
example, even if _ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on 32bit
architectures will probably be _ZThn16_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base
on 64bit ones, it can be matched with a single <i>c++</i>
pattern:</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">libdummy.so.1
libdummy1 #MINVER# <br>
[...] <br>
(c++)&quot;non-virtual thunk to
NSB::ClassD::~ClassD()@Base&quot; 1.0 <br>
[...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The demangled
name above can be obtained by executing the following
command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ echo
'_ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base' | c++filt</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that while mangled name is unique in the library by
definition, this is not necessarily true for demangled
names. A couple of distinct real symbols may have the same
demangled name. For example, that&rsquo;s the case with
non-virtual thunk symbols in complex inheritance
configurations or with most constructors and destructors
(since g++ typically generates two real symbols for them).
However, as these collisions happen on the
<small>ABI</small> level, they should not degrade quality of
the symbol file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>symver</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This pattern is denoted by the
<i>symver</i> tag. Well maintained libraries have versioned
symbols where each version corresponds to the upstream
version where the symbol got added. If that&rsquo;s the
case, you can use a <i>symver</i> pattern to match any
symbol associated to the specific version. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">libc.so.6 libc6
#MINVER# <br>
(symver)GLIBC_2.0 2.0 <br>
[...] <br>
(symver)GLIBC_2.7 2.7 <br>
access@GLIBC_2.0 2.2</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All symbols
associated with versions <small>GLIBC_2.0</small> and
<small>GLIBC_2.7</small> will lead to minimal version of 2.0
and 2.7 respectively with the exception of the symbol
access@GLIBC_2.0. The latter will lead to a minimal
dependency on libc6 version 2.2 despite being in the scope
of the &quot;(symver)GLIBC_2.0&quot; pattern because
specific symbols take precedence over patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that while old style wildcard patterns (denoted by
&quot;*@version&quot; in the symbol name field) are still
supported, they have been deprecated by new style syntax
&quot;(symver|optional)version&quot;. For example,
&quot;*@GLIBC_2.0 2.0&quot; should be written as
&quot;(symver|optional)GLIBC_2.0 2.0&quot; if the same
behaviour is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>regex</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Regular expression patterns are
denoted by the <i>regex</i> tag. They match by the perl
regular expression specified in the symbol name field. A
regular expression is matched as it is, therefore do not
forget to start it with the <i>^</i> character or it may
match any part of the real symbol <i>name@version</i>
string. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">libdummy.so.1
libdummy1 #MINVER# <br>
(regex)&quot;^mystack_.*@Base$&quot; 1.0 <br>
(regex|optional)&quot;private&quot; 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Symbols like
&quot;mystack_new@Base&quot;, &quot;mystack_push@Base&quot;,
&quot;mystack_pop@Base&quot; etc. will be matched by the
first pattern while e.g. &quot;ng_mystack_new@Base&quot;
won&rsquo;t. The second pattern will match all symbols
having the string &quot;private&quot; in their names and
matches will inherit <i>optional</i> tag from the
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Basic patterns
listed above can be combined where it makes sense. In that
case, they are processed in the order in which the tags are
specified. For example, both:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(c++|regex)&quot;^NSA::ClassA::Private::privmethod\d\(int\)@Base&quot;
1.0 <br>
(regex|c++)N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will match
symbols
&quot;_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod1Ei@Base&quot; and
&quot;_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod2Ei@Base&quot;. When
matching the first pattern, the raw symbol is first
demangled as C <small>++</small> symbol, then the demangled
name is matched against the regular expression. On the other
hand, when matching the second pattern, regular expression
is matched against the raw symbol name, then the symbol is
tested if it is C <small>++</small> one by attempting to
demangle it. A failure of any basic pattern will result in
the failure of the whole pattern. Therefore, for example,
&quot;__N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base&quot; will
not match either of the patterns because it is not a valid C
<small>++</small> symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general, all
patterns are divided into two groups: aliases (basic
<i>c++</i> and <i>symver</i>) and generic patterns
(<i>regex</i>, all combinations of multiple basic patterns).
Matching of basic alias-based patterns is fast (O(1)) while
generic patterns are O(N) (N - generic pattern count) for
each symbol. Therefore, it is recommended not to overuse
generic patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When multiple
patterns match the same real symbol, aliases (first
<i>c++</i>, then <i>symver</i>) are preferred over generic
patterns. Generic patterns are matched in the order they are
found in the symbol file template until the first success.
Please note, however, that manual reordering of template
file entries is not recommended because
<b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> generates diffs based on the
alphanumerical order of their names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
includes</b> <br>
When the set of exported symbols differ between
architectures, it may become inefficient to use a single
symbol file. In those cases, an include directive may prove
to be useful in a couple of ways:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>You can factorize the common part in some external file
and include that file in your
<i>package</i>.symbols.<i>arch</i> file by using an include
directive like this:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">#include
&quot;I&lt;packages&gt;.symbols.common&quot;</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The include directive may also
be tagged like any symbol:</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(tag|...|tagN)#include
&quot;file-to-include&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a result,
all symbols included from <i>file-to-include</i> will be
considered to be tagged with <i>tag</i> ... <i>tagN</i> by
default. You can use this feature to create a common
<i>package</i>.symbols file which includes architecture
specific symbol files:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">common_symbol1@Base
1.0 <br>
(arch=amd64 ia64 alpha)#include
&quot;package.symbols.64bit&quot; <br>
(arch=!amd64 !ia64 !alpha)#include
&quot;package.symbols.32bit&quot; <br>
common_symbol2@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The symbols
files are read line by line, and include directives are
processed as soon as they are encountered. This means that
the content of the included file can override any content
that appeared before the include directive and that any
content after the directive can override anything contained
in the included file. Any symbol (or even another #include
directive) in the included file can specify additional tags
or override values of the inherited tags in its tag
specification. However, there is no way for the symbol to
remove any of the inherited tags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An included
file can repeat the header line containing the
<small>SONAME</small> of the library. In that case, it
overrides any header line previously read. However, in
general it&rsquo;s best to avoid duplicating header lines.
One way to do it is the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#include
&quot;libsomething1.symbols.common&quot; <br>
arch_specific_symbol@Base 1.0</p>
