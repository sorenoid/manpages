<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">deb - Debian
binary package format</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>filename</i><b>.deb</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>.deb</b>
format is the Debian binary package file format. It is
understood since dpkg 0.93.76, and is generated by default
since dpkg 1.2.0 and 1.1.1elf (i386/ELF builds).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format
described here is used since Debian 0.93; details of the old
format are described in <b>deb-old</b>(5).</p>

<h2>FORMAT
<a name="FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file is an
<b>ar</b> archive with a magic value of
<b>!&lt;arch&gt;</b>. Only the common <b>ar</b> archive
format is supported, with no long file name extensions, but
with file names containing an optional trailing slash, which
limits their length to 15 characters (from the 16 allowed).
File sizes are limited to 10 <small>ASCII</small> decimal
digits, allowing for up to approximately 9536.74 MiB member
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>tar</b>
archives currently allowed are, the old-style (v7) format,
the pre-POSIX ustar format, a subset of the
<small>GNU</small> format (new style long pathnames and long
linknames, supported since dpkg 1.4.1.17; large file
metadata since dpkg 1.18.24), and the <small>POSIX</small>
ustar format (long names supported since dpkg 1.15.0).
Unrecognized tar typeflags are considered an error. Each tar
entry size inside a tar archive is limited to 11
<small>ASCII</small> octal digits, allowing for up to 8 GiB
tar entries. The <small>GNU</small> large file metadata
support permits 95-bit tar entry sizes and negative
timestamps, and 63-bit <small>UID, GID</small> and device
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
member is named <b>debian-binary</b> and contains a series
of lines, separated by newlines. Currently only one line is
present, the format version number, <b>2.0</b> at the time
this manual page was written. Programs which read new-format
archives should be prepared for the minor number to be
increased and new lines to be present, and should ignore
these if this is the case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the major
number has changed, an incompatible change has been made and
the program should stop. If it has not, then the program
should be able to safely continue, unless it encounters an
unexpected member in the archive (except at the end), as
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
required member is named <b>control.tar</b>. It is a tar
archive containing the package control information, either
not compressed (supported since dpkg 1.17.6), or compressed
with gzip (with <b>.gz</b> extension) or xz (with <b>.xz</b>
extension, supported since 1.17.6), as a series of plain
files, of which the file <b>control</b> is mandatory and
contains the core control information, the <b>md5sums</b>,
<b>conffiles</b>, <b>triggers</b>, <b>shlibs</b> and
<b>symbols</b> files contain optional control information,
and the <b>preinst</b>, <b>postinst</b>, <b>prerm</b> and
<b>postrm</b> files are optional maintainer scripts. The
control tarball may optionally contain an entry for
&rsquo;<b>.</b>&rsquo;, the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third, last
required member is named <b>data.tar</b>. It contains the
filesystem as a tar archive, either not compressed
(supported since dpkg 1.10.24), or compressed with gzip
(with <b>.gz</b> extension), xz (with <b>.xz</b> extension,
supported since dpkg 1.15.6), bzip2 (with <b>.bz2</b>
extension, supported since dpkg 1.10.24) or lzma (with
<b>.lzma</b> extension, supported since dpkg 1.13.25).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These members
must occur in this exact order. Current implementations
should ignore any additional members after <b>data.tar</b>.
Further members may be defined in the future, and (if
possible) will be placed after these three. Any additional
members that may need to be inserted after
<b>debian-binary</b> and before <b>control.tar</b> or
<b>data.tar</b> and which should be safely ignored by older
programs, will have names starting with an underscore,
&rsquo;<b>_</b>&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Those new
members which won&rsquo;t be able to be safely ignored will
be inserted before <b>data.tar</b> with names starting with
something other than underscores, or will (more likely)
cause the major version number to be increased.</p>
