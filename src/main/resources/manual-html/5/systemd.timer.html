</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">systemd.timer -
Timer unit configuration</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>timer</i>.timer</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A unit
configuration file whose name ends in &quot;.timer&quot;
encodes information about a timer controlled and supervised
by systemd, for timer-based activation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This man page
lists the configuration options specific to this unit type.
See <b>systemd.unit</b>(5) for the common options of all
unit configuration files. The common configuration items are
configured in the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The
timer specific configuration options are configured in the
[Timer] section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each timer
file, a matching unit file must exist, describing the unit
to activate when the timer elapses. By default, a service by
the same name as the timer (except for the suffix) is
activated. Example: a timer file foo.timer activates a
matching service foo.service. The unit to activate may be
controlled by <i>Unit=</i> (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
case the unit to activate is already active at the time the
timer elapses it is not restarted, but simply left running.
There is no concept of spawning new service instances in
this case. Due to this, services with
<i>RemainAfterExit=</i> set (which stay around continuously
even after the service's main process exited) are usually
not suitable for activation via repetitive timers, as they
will only be activated once, and then stay around
forever.</p>

<h2>AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES
<a name="AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Implicit
Dependencies</b> <br>
The following dependencies are implicitly added:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Timer
units automatically gain a <i>Before=</i> dependency on the
service they are supposed to activate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Default
Dependencies</b> <br>
The following dependencies are added unless
<i>DefaultDependencies=no</i> is set:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Timer
units will automatically have dependencies of type
<i>Requires=</i> and <i>After=</i> on sysinit.target, a
dependency of type <i>Before=</i> on timers.target, as well
as <i>Conflicts=</i> and <i>Before=</i> on shutdown.target
to ensure that they are stopped cleanly prior to system
shutdown. Only timer units involved with early boot or late
system shutdown should disable the
<i>DefaultDependencies=</i> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Timer
units with at least one <i>OnCalendar=</i> directive acquire
a pair of additional <i>After=</i> dependencies on
time-set.target and time-sync.target, in order to avoid
being started before the system clock has been correctly
set. See <b>systemd.special</b>(7) for details on these two
targets.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Timer files
must include a [Timer] section, which carries information
about the timer it defines. The options specific to the
[Timer] section of timer units are the following:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>OnActiveSec=</i>,
<i>OnBootSec=</i>, <i>OnStartupSec=</i>,
<i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>, <i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines monotonic timers
relative to different starting points:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Table&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Settings
and their starting points</b></p>


<p align="center"><b><img src="grohtml-3455571.png" alt="Image grohtml-3455571.png"></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple
directives may be combined of the same and of different
types, in which case the timer unit will trigger whenever
any of the specified timer expressions elapse. For example,
by combining <i>OnBootSec=</i> and <i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>,
it is possible to define a timer that elapses in regular
intervals and activates a specific service each time.
Moreover, both monotonic time expressions and
<i>OnCalendar=</i> calendar expressions may be combined in
the same timer unit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The arguments
to the directives are time spans configured in seconds.
Example: &quot;OnBootSec=50&quot; means 50s after boot-up.
The argument may also include time units. Example:
&quot;OnBootSec=5h 30min&quot; means 5 hours and 30 minutes
after boot-up. For details about the syntax of time spans,
see <b>systemd.time</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a timer
configured with <i>OnBootSec=</i> or <i>OnStartupSec=</i> is
already in the past when the timer unit is activated, it
will immediately elapse and the configured unit is started.
This is not the case for timers defined in the other
directives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These are
monotonic timers, independent of wall-clock time and
timezones. If the computer is temporarily suspended, the
monotonic clock generally pauses, too. Note that if
<i>WakeSystem=</i> is used, a different monotonic clock is
selected that continues to advance while the system is
suspended and thus can be used as the trigger to resume the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the empty
string is assigned to any of these options, the list of
timers is reset (both monotonic timers and
<i>OnCalendar=</i> timers, see below), and all prior
assignments will have no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time
configured with these settings, as they are subject to the
<i>AccuracySec=</i> setting below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>OnCalendar=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines realtime (i.e.
wallclock) timers with calendar event expressions. See
<b>systemd.time</b>(7) for more information on the syntax of
calendar event expressions. Otherwise, the semantics are
similar to <i>OnActiveSec=</i> and related settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time
configured with this setting, as it is subject to the
<i>AccuracySec=</i> setting below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">May be
specified more than once, in which case the timer unit will
trigger whenever any of the specified expressions elapse.
Moreover calendar timers and monotonic timers (see above)
may be combined within the same timer unit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the empty
string is assigned to any of these options, the list of
timers is reset (both <i>OnCalendar=</i> timers and
monotonic timers, see above), and all prior assignments will
have no effect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>AccuracySec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the accuracy the timer
shall elapse with. Defaults to 1min. The timer is scheduled
to elapse within a time window starting with the time
specified in <i>OnCalendar=</i>, <i>OnActiveSec=</i>,
<i>OnBootSec=</i>, <i>OnStartupSec=</i>,
<i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i> or <i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i> and
ending the time configured with <i>AccuracySec=</i> later.
Within this time window, the expiry time will be placed at a
host-specific, randomized, but stable position that is
synchronized between all local timer units. This is done in
order to optimize power consumption to suppress unnecessary
CPU wake-ups. To get best accuracy, set this option to 1us.
Note that the timer is still subject to the timer slack
configured via <b>systemd-system.conf</b>(5)'s
<i>TimerSlackNSec=</i> setting. See <a href="https://man.page/2/prctl">prctl(2)</a> for
details. To optimize power consumption, make sure to set
this value as high as possible and as low as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
setting is primarily a power saving option that allows
coalescing CPU wake-ups. It should not be confused with
<i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> (see below) which adds a random
value to the time the timer shall elapse next and whose
purpose is the opposite: to stretch elapsing of timer events
over a longer period to reduce workload spikes. For further
details and explanations and how both settings play
together, see below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Delay the timer by a randomly
selected, evenly distributed amount of time between 0 and
the specified time value. Defaults to 0, indicating that no
randomized delay shall be applied. Each timer unit will
determine this delay randomly before each iteration, and the
delay will simply be added on top of the next determined
elapsing time, unless modified with
<i>FixedRandomDelay=</i>, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This setting is
useful to stretch dispatching of similarly configured timer
events over a certain time interval, to prevent them from
firing all at the same time, possibly resulting in resource
congestion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the
relation to <i>AccuracySec=</i> above: the latter allows the
service manager to coalesce timer events within a specified
time range in order to minimize wakeups, while this setting
does the opposite: it stretches timer events over an
interval, to make it unlikely that they fire simultaneously.
If <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> and <i>AccuracySec=</i> are
used in conjunction, first the randomized delay is added,
and then the result is possibly further shifted to coalesce
it with other timer events happening on the system. As
mentioned above <i>AccuracySec=</i> defaults to 1 minute and
<i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> to 0, thus encouraging coalescing
of timer events. In order to optimally stretch timer events
over a certain range of time, set <i>AccuracySec=1us</i> and
<i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> to some higher value.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>FixedRandomDelay=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument. When
enabled, the randomized offset specified by
<i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> is reused for all firings of the
same timer. For a given timer unit, the offset depends on
the machine ID, user identifier and timer name, which means
that it is stable between restarts of the manager. This
effectively creates a fixed offset for an individual timer,
reducing the jitter in firings of this timer, while still
avoiding firing at the same time as other similarly
configured timers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This setting
has no effect if <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> is set to 0.
Defaults to <b>false</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>OnClockChange=</i>,
<i>OnTimezoneChange=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These options take boolean
arguments. When true, the service unit will be triggered
when the system clock (<b>CLOCK_REALTIME</b>) jumps relative
to the monotonic clock (<b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>), or when the
local system timezone is modified. These options can be used
alone or in combination with other timer expressions (see
above) within the same timer unit. These options default to
<b>false</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Unit=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The unit to activate when this
timer elapses. The argument is a unit name, whose suffix is
not &quot;.timer&quot;. If not specified, this value
defaults to a service that has the same name as the timer
unit, except for the suffix. (See above.) It is recommended
that the unit name that is activated and the unit name of
the timer unit are named identically, except for the
suffix.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Persistent=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument. If
true, the time when the service unit was last triggered is
stored on disk. When the timer is activated, the service
unit is triggered immediately if it would have been
triggered at least once during the time when the timer was
inactive. Such triggering is nonetheless subject to the
delay imposed by <i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i>. This is useful
to catch up on missed runs of the service when the system
was powered down. Note that this setting only has an effect
on timers configured with <i>OnCalendar=</i>. Defaults to
<b>false</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<b>systemctl clean --what=state ...</b> on the timer unit to
remove the timestamp file maintained by this option from
disk. In particular, use this command before uninstalling a
timer unit. See <a href="https://man.page/1/systemctl">systemctl(1)</a> for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>WakeSystem=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument. If
true, an elapsing timer will cause the system to resume from
suspend, should it be suspended and if the system supports
this. Note that this option will only make sure the system
resumes on the appropriate times, it will not take care of
suspending it again after any work that is to be done is
finished. Defaults to <b>false</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
functionality requires privileges and is thus generally only
available in the system service manager.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
behaviour of monotonic clock timers (as configured with
<i>OnActiveSec=</i>, <i>OnBootSec=</i>,
<i>OnStartupSec=</i>, <i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>,
<i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i>, see above) is altered depending
on this option. If false, a monotonic clock is used that is
paused during system suspend (<b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>), if
true a different monotonic clock is used that continues
advancing during system suspend (<b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME</b>), see
<a href="https://man.page/2/clock_getres">clock_getres(2)</a> for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>RemainAfterElapse=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument. If
true, a timer will stay loaded, and its state remains
queryable even after it elapsed and the associated unit (as
configured with <i>Unit=</i>, see above) deactivated again.
If false, an elapsed timer unit that cannot elapse anymore
is unloaded once its associated unit deactivated again.
Turning this off is particularly useful for transient timer
units. Note that this setting has an effect when repeatedly
starting a timer unit: if <i>RemainAfterElapse=</i> is on,
starting the timer a second time has no effect. However, if
<i>RemainAfterElapse=</i> is off and the timer unit was
already unloaded, it can be started again, and thus the
service can be triggered multiple times. Defaults to
<b>true</b>.</p>
