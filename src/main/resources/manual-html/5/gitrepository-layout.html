<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$GIT_DIR/*</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Git
repository comes in two different flavours:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; a
<b>.git</b> directory at the root of the working tree;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; a
<b>&lt;project&gt;.git</b> directory that is a <i>bare</i>
repository (i.e. without its own working tree), that is
typically used for exchanging histories with others by
pushing into it and fetching from it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note</b>:
Also you can have a plain text file <b>.git</b> at the root
of your working tree, containing <b>gitdir: &lt;path&gt;</b>
to point at the real directory that has the repository. This
mechanism is often used for a working tree of a submodule
checkout, to allow you in the containing superproject to
<b>git checkout</b> a branch that does not have the
submodule. The <b>checkout</b> has to remove the entire
submodule working tree, without losing the submodule
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These things
may exist in a Git repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">objects</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Object store associated with
this repository. Usually an object store is self sufficient
(i.e. all the objects that are referred to by an object
found in it are also found in it), but there are a few ways
to violate it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">1. You could
have an incomplete but locally usable repository by creating
a shallow clone. See <b>git-clone</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">2. You could be
using the <b>objects/info/alternates</b> or
<b>$GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES</b> mechanisms to
<i>borrow</i> objects from other object stores. A repository
with this kind of incomplete object store is not suitable to
be published for use with dumb transports but otherwise is
OK as long as <b>objects/info/alternates</b> points at the
object stores it borrows from.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This directory
is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
&quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/objects&quot; will be used
instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">objects/[0-9a-f][0-9a-f]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A newly created object is
stored in its own file. The objects are splayed over 256
subdirectories using the first two characters of the sha1
object name to keep the number of directory entries in
<b>objects</b> itself to a manageable number. Objects found
here are often called <i>unpacked</i> (or <i>loose</i>)
objects.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">objects/pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Packs (files that store many
objects in compressed form, along with index files to allow
them to be randomly accessed) are found in this
directory.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">objects/info</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Additional information about
the object store is recorded in this directory.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">objects/info/packs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This file is to help dumb
transports discover what packs are available in this object
store. Whenever a pack is added or removed, <b>git
update-server-info</b> should be run to keep this file up to
date if the repository is published for dumb transports.
<i>git repack</i> does this by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">objects/info/alternates</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This file records paths to
alternate object stores that this object store borrows
objects from, one pathname per line. Note that not only
native Git tools use it locally, but the HTTP fetcher also
tries to use it remotely; this will usually work if you have
relative paths (relative to the object database, not to the
repository!) in your alternates file, but it will not work
if you use absolute paths unless the absolute path in
filesystem and web URL is the same. See also
<b>objects/info/http-alternates</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">objects/info/http-alternates</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This file records URLs to
alternate object stores that this object store borrows
objects from, to be used when the repository is fetched over
HTTP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">refs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">References are stored in
subdirectories of this directory. The <i>git prune</i>
command knows to preserve objects reachable from refs found
in this directory and its subdirectories. This directory is
ignored (except refs/bisect, refs/rewritten and
refs/worktree) if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
&quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/refs&quot; will be used instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">refs/heads/<b>name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">records tip-of-the-tree commit
objects of branch <b>name</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">refs/tags/<b>name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">records any object name (not
necessarily a commit object, or a tag object that points at
a commit object).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">refs/remotes/<b>name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">records tip-of-the-tree commit
objects of branches copied from a remote repository.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">refs/replace/<b>&lt;obj-sha1&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">records the SHA-1 of the object
that replaces <b>&lt;obj-sha1&gt;</b>. This is similar to
info/grafts and is internally used and maintained by
<b>git-replace</b>(1). Such refs can be exchanged between
repositories while grafts are not.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">packed-refs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">records the same information as
refs/heads/, refs/tags/, and friends record in a more
efficient way. See <b>git-pack-refs</b>(1). This file is
ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
&quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/packed-refs&quot; will be used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A symref (see glossary) to the
<b>refs/heads/</b> namespace describing the currently active
branch. It does not mean much if the repository is not
associated with any working tree (i.e. a <i>bare</i>
repository), but a valid Git repository <b>must</b> have the
HEAD file; some porcelains may use it to guess the
designated &quot;default&quot; branch of the repository
(usually <i>master</i>). It is legal if the named branch
<i>name</i> does not (yet) exist. In some legacy setups, it
is a symbolic link instead of a symref that points at the
current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD can also
record a specific commit directly, instead of being a symref
to point at the current branch. Such a state is often called
<i>detached HEAD.</i> See <b>git-checkout</b>(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">config</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Repository specific
configuration file. This file is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR
is set and &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config&quot; will be used
instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">config.worktree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Working directory specific
configuration file for the main working directory in
multiple working directory setup (see
<b>git-worktree</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">branches</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A slightly deprecated way to
store shorthands to be used to specify a URL to <i>git
fetch</i>, <i>git pull</i> and <i>git push</i>. A file can
be stored as <b>branches/&lt;name&gt;</b> and then
<i>name</i> can be given to these commands in place of
<i>repository</i> argument. See the REMOTES section in
<b>git-fetch</b>(1) for details. This mechanism is legacy
and not likely to be found in modern repositories. This
directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
&quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/branches&quot; will be used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hooks</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Hooks are customization scripts
used by various Git commands. A handful of sample hooks are
installed when <i>git init</i> is run, but all of them are
disabled by default. To enable, the <b>.sample</b> suffix
has to be removed from the filename by renaming. Read
<b>githooks</b>(5) for more details about each hook. This
directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
&quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/hooks&quot; will be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">common</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When multiple working trees are
used, most of files in $GIT_DIR are per-worktree with a few
known exceptions. All files under <i>common</i> however will
be shared between all working trees.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The current index file for the
repository. It is usually not found in a bare
repository.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sharedindex.&lt;SHA-1&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The shared index part, to be
referenced by $GIT_DIR/index and other temporary index
files. Only valid in split index mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">info</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Additional information about
the repository is recorded in this directory. This directory
is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
&quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info&quot; will be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">info/refs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This file helps dumb transports
discover what refs are available in this repository. If the
repository is published for dumb transports, this file
should be regenerated by <i>git update-server-info</i> every
time a tag or branch is created or modified. This is
normally done from the <b>hooks/update</b> hook, which is
run by the <i>git-receive-pack</i> command when you <i>git
push</i> into the repository.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">info/grafts</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This file records fake commit
ancestry information, to pretend the set of parents a commit
has is different from how the commit was actually created.
One record per line describes a commit and its fake parents
by listing their 40-byte hexadecimal object names separated
by a space and terminated by a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
grafts mechanism is outdated and can lead to problems
transferring objects between repositories; see
<b>git-replace</b>(1) for a more flexible and robust system
to do the same thing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">info/exclude</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This file, by convention among
Porcelains, stores the exclude pattern list.
<b>.gitignore</b> is the per-directory ignore file. <i>git
status</i>, <i>git add</i>, <i>git rm</i> and <i>git
clean</i> look at it but the core Git commands do not look
at it. See also: <b>gitignore</b>(5).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">info/attributes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines which attributes to
assign to a path, similar to per-directory
<b>.gitattributes</b> files. See also:
<b>gitattributes</b>(5).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">info/sparse-checkout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This file stores sparse
checkout patterns. See also: <b>git-read-tree</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">remotes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stores shorthands for URL and
default refnames for use when interacting with remote
repositories via <i>git fetch</i>, <i>git pull</i> and
<i>git push</i> commands. See the REMOTES section in
<b>git-fetch</b>(1) for details. This mechanism is legacy
and not likely to be found in modern repositories. This
directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
&quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/remotes&quot; will be used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">logs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Records of changes made to refs
are stored in this directory. See <b>git-update-ref</b>(1)
for more information. This directory is ignored (except
logs/HEAD) if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
&quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/logs&quot; will be used instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">logs/refs/heads/<b>name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Records all changes made to the
branch tip named <b>name</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">logs/refs/tags/<b>name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Records all changes made to the
tag named <b>name</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">shallow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is similar to
<b>info/grafts</b> but is internally used and maintained by
shallow clone mechanism. See <b>--depth</b> option to
<b>git-clone</b>(1) and <b>git-fetch</b>(1). This file is
ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
&quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/shallow&quot; will be used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">commondir</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this file exists,
$GIT_COMMON_DIR (see <b>git</b>(1)) will be set to the path
specified in this file if it is not explicitly set. If the
specified path is relative, it is relative to $GIT_DIR. The
repository with commondir is incomplete without the
repository pointed by &quot;commondir&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">modules</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Contains the git-repositories
of the submodules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">worktrees</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Contains administrative data
for linked working trees. Each subdirectory contains the
working tree-related part of a linked working tree. This
directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set, in which
case &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees&quot; will be used
instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/gitdir</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A text file containing the
absolute path back to the .git file that points to here.
This is used to check if the linked repository has been
manually removed and there is no need to keep this directory
any more. The mtime of this file should be updated every
time the linked repository is accessed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/locked</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this file exists, the linked
working tree may be on a portable device and not available.
The presence of this file prevents
<b>worktrees/&lt;id&gt;</b> from being pruned either
automatically or manually by <b>git worktree prune</b>. The
file may contain a string explaining why the repository is
locked.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Working directory specific
configuration file.</p>

<h2>GIT REPOSITORY FORMAT VERSIONS
<a name="GIT REPOSITORY FORMAT VERSIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Every git
repository is marked with a numeric version in the
<b>core.repositoryformatversion</b> key of its <b>config</b>
file. This version specifies the rules for operating on the
on-disk repository data. An implementation of git which does
not understand a particular version advertised by an on-disk
repository MUST NOT operate on that repository; doing so
risks not only producing wrong results, but actually losing
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of this
rule, version bumps should be kept to an absolute minimum.
Instead, we generally prefer these strategies:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; bumping
format version numbers of individual data files (e.g.,
index, packfiles, etc). This restricts the incompatibilities
only to those files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
introducing new data that gracefully degrades when used by
older clients (e.g., pack bitmap files are ignored by older
clients, which simply do not take advantage of the
optimization they provide).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
whole-repository format version bump should only be part of
a change that cannot be independently versioned. For
instance, if one were to change the reachability rules for
objects, or the rules for locking refs, that would require a
bump of the repository format version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
applies only to accessing the repository&rsquo;s disk
contents directly. An older client which understands only
format <b>0</b> may still connect via <b>git://</b> to a
repository using format <b>1</b>, as long as the server
process understands format <b>1</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The preferred
strategy for rolling out a version bump (whether whole
repository or for a single file) is to teach git to read the
new format, and allow writing the new format with a config
switch or command line option (for experimentation or for
those who do not care about backwards compatibility with
older gits). Then after a long period to allow the reading
capability to become common, we may switch to writing the
new format by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The currently
defined format versions are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Version
0</b> <br>
This is the format defined by the initial version of git,
including but not limited to the format of the repository
directory, the repository configuration file, and the object
and ref storage. Specifying the complete behavior of git is
beyond the scope of this document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Version
1</b> <br>
This format is identical to version <b>0</b>, with the
following exceptions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. When reading
the <b>core.repositoryformatversion</b> variable, a git
implementation which supports version 1 MUST also read any
configuration keys found in the <b>extensions</b> section of
the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. If a
version-1 repository specifies any <b>extensions.*</b> keys
that the running git has not implemented, the operation MUST
NOT proceed. Similarly, if the value of any known key is not
understood by the implementation, the operation MUST NOT
proceed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if no
extensions are specified in the config file, then
<b>core.repositoryformatversion</b> SHOULD be set to
<b>0</b> (setting it to <b>1</b> provides no benefit, and
makes the repository incompatible with older implementations
of git).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
will serve as the master list for extensions. Any
implementation wishing to define a new extension should make
a note of it here, in order to claim the name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The defined
extensions are:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>noop</big></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This extension does not change
git&rsquo;s behavior at all. It is useful only for testing
format-1 compatibility.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>preciousObjects</big></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When the config key
<b>extensions.preciousObjects</b> is set to <b>true</b>,
objects in the repository MUST NOT be deleted (e.g., by
<b>git-prune</b> or <b>git repack -d</b>).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>partialclone</big></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When the config key
<b>extensions.partialclone</b> is set, it indicates that the
repo was created with a partial clone (or later performed a
partial fetch) and that the remote may have omitted sending
certain unwanted objects. Such a remote is called a
&quot;promisor remote&quot; and it promises that all such
omitted objects can be fetched from it in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The value of
this key is the name of the promisor remote.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>worktreeConfig</big></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If set, by default &quot;git
config&quot; reads from both &quot;config&quot; and
&quot;config.worktree&quot; file from GIT_DIR in that order.
In multiple working directory mode, &quot;config&quot; file
is shared while &quot;config.worktree&quot; is per-working
directory (i.e., it&rsquo;s in
GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree)</p>
