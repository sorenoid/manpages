<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cups-browsed.conf</b>
- server configuration file for cups-browsed</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
cups-browsed.conf file configures the cups-browsed daemon.
It is normally located in the /etc/cups directory. Each line
in the file can be a configuration directive, a blank line,
or a comment. Comment lines start with the # character.</p>

<h2>DIRECTIVES
<a name="DIRECTIVES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;CacheDir&quot; directive determines where cups-browsed
should save information about the print queues it had
generated when shutting down, like whether one of these
queues was the default printer, or default option settings
of the queues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CacheDir
/var/cache/cups</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With
&quot;LogDir&quot; can be defined where cups-browsed creates
its debug log file (if &quot;DebugLogging file&quot; is
set).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">LogDir
/var/log/cups</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;DebugLogging&quot; directive determines how should
debug logging be done. Into the file
/var/log/cups/cups-browsed_log (&quot;file&quot;), to stderr
(&quot;stderr&quot;), or not at all (&quot;none&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
cups-browsed is running as a system service (for example via
systemd) logging to stderr makes the log output going to the
journal or syslog. Only if you run cups-browsed from the
command line (for development or debugging) it will actually
appear on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DebugLogging
file <br>
DebugLogging stderr <br>
DebugLogging file stderr <br>
DebugLogging none</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only browse
remote printers (via DNS-SD or CUPS browsing) from selected
servers using the &quot;BrowseAllow&quot;,
&quot;BrowseDeny&quot;, and &quot;BrowseOrder&quot;
directives</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This serves for
restricting the choice of printers in print dialogs to
trusted servers or to reduce the number of listed printers
in the print dialogs to a more user-friendly amount in large
networks with very many shared printers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This only
filters the selection of remote printers for which
cups-browsed creates local queues. If the print dialog uses
other mechanisms to list remote printers as for example
direct DNS-SD access, cups-browsed has no influence.
cups-browsed also does not prevent the user from manually
accessing non-listed printers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;BrowseAllow&quot;:
Accept printers from these hosts or networks. If there are
only &quot;BrowseAllow&quot; lines and no
&quot;BrowseOrder&quot; and/or &quot;BrowseDeny&quot; lines,
only servers matching at last one &quot;BrowseAllow&quot;
line are accepted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;BrowseDeny&quot;:
Deny printers from these hosts or networks. If there are
only &quot;BrowseDeny&quot; lines and no
&quot;BrowseOrder&quot; and/or &quot;BrowseAllow&quot;
lines, all servers NOT matching any of the
&quot;BrowseDeny&quot; lines are accepted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;BrowseOrder&quot;:
Determine the order in which &quot;BrowseAllow&quot; and
&quot;BrowseDeny&quot; lines are applied. With
&quot;BrowseOrder Deny,Allow&quot; in the beginning all
servers are accepted, then the &quot;BrowseDeny&quot; lines
are applied to exclude unwished servers or networks and
after that the &quot;BrowseAllow&quot; lines to re-include
servers or networks. With &quot;BrowseOrder Allow,Deny&quot;
we start with denying all servers, then applying the
&quot;BrowseAllow&quot; lines and afterwards the
&quot;BrowseDeny&quot; lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Default for
&quot;BrowseOrder&quot; is &quot;Deny.Allow&quot; if there
are both &quot;BrowseAllow&quot; and &quot;BrowseDeny&quot;
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there are no
&quot;Browse...&quot; lines at all, all servers are
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseAllow All
<br>
BrowseAllow 192.168.7.20 <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Filtering of
remote printers by other properties than IP addresses of
their servers</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Often the
desired selection of printers cannot be reached by only
taking into account the IP addresses of the servers. For
these cases there is the BrowseFilter directive to filter by
most of the known properties of the printer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default
there is no BrowseFilter line meaning that no filtering is
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To do filtering
one can supply one or more BrowseFilter directives like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
[NOT] [EXACT] &lt;FIELD&gt; [&lt;VALUE&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
BrowseFilter directive always starts with the word
&quot;BrowseFilter&quot; and it must at least contain the
name of the data field (&lt;FIELD&gt;) of the
printer&rsquo;s properties to which it should apply.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Available field
names are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">name: Name of
the local print queue to be created <br>
host: Host name of the remote print server <br>
port: Port through which the printer is accessed on the
server <br>
service: DNS/SD service name of the remote printer <br>
domain: Domain of the remote print server</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also all field
names in the TXT records of DNS-SD-advertised printers are
valid, like &quot;color&quot;, &quot;duplex&quot;,
&quot;pdl&quot;, ... If the field name of the filter rule
does not exist for the printer, the rule is skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
&lt;VALUE&gt; field is either the exact value (when the
option EXACT is supplied) or a regular expression (Run
&quot;man 7 regex&quot; in a terminal window) to be matched
with the data field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no
&lt;VALUE&gt; filed is supplied, rules with field names of
the TXT record are considered for boolean matching
(true/false) of boolean field (like duplex, which can have
the values &quot;T&quot; for true and &quot;F&quot; for
false).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the option
NOT is supplied, the filter rule is fulfilled if the regular
expression or the exact value DOES NOT match the content of
the data field. In a boolean rule (without &lt;VALUE&gt;)
the rule matches false.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Regular
expressions are always considered case-insensitive and
extended POSIX regular expressions. Field names and options
(NOT, EXACT) are all evaluated case-insensitive. If there is
an error in a regular expression, the BrowseFilter line gets
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Especially to
note is that supplying any simple string consisting of only
letters, numbers, spaces, and some basic special characters
as a regular expression matches if it is contained somewhere
in the data field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there is
more than one BrowseFilter directive, ALL the directives
need to be fulfilled for the remote printer to be accepted.
If one is not fulfilled, the printer will get ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rules for
standard data items which are supplied with any remote
printer advertised via DNS-SD:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Print queue
name must contain &quot;hum_res_&quot;, this matches
&quot;hum_res_mono&quot; or &quot;hum_res_color&quot; but
also &quot;old_hum_res_mono&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
name hum_res_</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This matches if
the remote host name contains &quot;printserver&quot;, like
&quot;printserver.local&quot;,
&quot;printserver2.example.com&quot;,
&quot;newprintserver&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
host printserver</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This matches
all ports with 631 int its number, for example 631, 8631,
10631,...:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
port 631</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This rule
matches if the DNS-SD service name contains &quot;@
printserver&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Browsefilter
service @ printserver</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Matches all
domains with &quot;local&quot; in their names, not only
&quot;local&quot; but also things like
&quot;printlocally.com&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
domain local</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples for
rules applying to items of the TXT record:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This rule
selects PostScript printers, as the &quot;PDL&quot; field in
the TXT record contains &quot;postscript&quot; then. This
includes also remote CUPS queues which accept PostScript,
independent of whether the physical printer behind the CUPS
queue accepts PostScript or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
pdl postscript</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Color printers
usually contain a &quot;Color&quot; entry set to
&quot;T&quot; (for true) in the TXT record. This rule
selects them:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
color</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
similar rule to select only duplex (automatic double-sided
printing) printers:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
duplex</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rules with the
NOT option:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This rule
EXCLUDES printers from all hosts containing
&quot;financial&quot; in their names, nice to get rid of the
100s of printers of the financial department:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
NOT host financial</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Get only
monochrome printers (&quot;Color&quot; set to &quot;F&quot;,
meaning false, in the TXT record):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
NOT color</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rules with more
advanced use of regular expressions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only queue
names which BEGIN WITH &quot;hum_res_&quot; are accepted
now, so we still get &quot;hum_res_mono&quot; or
&quot;hum_res_color&quot; but not
&quot;old_hum_res_mono&quot; any more:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
name ^hum_res_</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Server names is
accepted if it contains &quot;print_server&quot; OR
&quot;graphics_dep_server&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseFilter
host print_server|graphics_dep_server</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;printserver1&quot;,

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples for
the EXACT option:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only printers

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The BrowsePoll
directive polls a server for available printers once every
60 seconds. Multiple BrowsePoll directives can be specified
to poll multiple servers. The default port to connect to is
631. BrowsePoll works independently of whether CUPS browsing
is activated in BrowseRemoteProtocols.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
BrowseLocalProtocols directive specifies the protocols to
use when advertising local shared printers on the network.
The default is &quot;none&quot;. Control of advertising of
local shared printers using dnssd is done in
/etc/cups/cupsd.conf.</p>

configuration for the LDAP browsing mode define where the
LDAP search should be performed. If built with an LDAP
library that supports TLS, the path to the server&rsquo;s
certificate, or to a certificates store, can be specified.
The optional filter allows the LDAP search to be more
specific, and is used in addition to the hardcoded filter

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
DomainSocket directive specifies the domain socket through
which the locally running CUPS daemon is accessed. If not
specified the standard domain socket of CUPS is used. Use
this if you have specified an alternative domain socket for
CUPS via a Listen directive in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. If
cups-browsed is not able to access the local CUPS daemon via
a domain socket it accesses it via localhost.
&quot;None&quot; or &quot;Off&quot; lets cups-browsed not
use CUPS&rsquo; domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Set HTTP
timeout (in seconds) for requests sent to local/remote
resources Note that too short timeouts can make services
getting missed when they are present and operations be
unnecessarily repeated and too long timeouts can make
operations take too long when the server does not

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Set how many
retries (N) should cups-browsed do for creating print queues
for remote printers which receive timeouts during print
queue creation. The printers which are not successfully set
up even after N retries, are skipped until the next restart
of the service. Note that too many retries can cause high
CPU load.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HttpMaxRetries

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
BrowseTimeout directive determines the amount of time that
browsing-related operations are allowed to take in seconds.
Notably, adding or removing one printer queue is considered
as one operation. The timeout applies to each one of those
operations. Especially queues discovered by CUPS broadcasts
will be removed after this timeout if no further broadcast
from the server happens.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BrowseTimeout
300</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
AllowResharingRemoteCUPSPrinters directive determines
whether a print queue pointing to a remote CUPS queue will
be re-shared to the local network or not. Since the queues
generated using the BrowsePoll directive are also pointing
to remote queues, they are also shared automatically if the
following option is set. Default is not to share remote
queues.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AllowResharingRemoteCUPSPrinters
Yes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
NewBrowsePollQueuesShared directive determines whether a
print queue for a newly discovered printer (discovered by
the BrowsePoll directive) will be shared to the local
network or not. This directive will only work if
AllowResharingRemoteCUPSPrinters is set to yes. Default is
not to share printers discovered using BrowsePoll.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NewBrowsePollQueuesShared
Yes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Set
OnlyUnsupportedByCUPS to &quot;Yes&quot; will make
cups-browsed not create local queues for remote printers for
which CUPS creates queues by itself. These printers are
printers advertised via DNS-SD and doing CUPS-supported
(currently PWG Raster and Apple Raster) driverless printing,
including remote CUPS queues. Queues for other printers
(like for legacy PostScript/PCL printers) are always created
(depending on the other configuration settings of
cups-browsed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With
OnlyUnsupportedByCUPS set to &quot;No&quot;, cups-browsed
creates queues for all printers which it supports, including
printers for which CUPS would create queues by itself.
Temporary queues created by CUPS will get overwritten. This
way it is assured that any extra functionality of
cups-browsed will apply to these queues. As queues created
by cups-browsed are permanent CUPS queues this setting is
also recommended if applications/print dialogs which do not
support temporary CUPS queues are installed. This setting is
the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OnlyUnsupportedByCUPS
Yes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With
UseCUPSGeneratedPPDs set to &quot;Yes&quot; cups-browsed
creates queues for IPP printers with PPDs generated by the
PPD generator of CUPS and not with the one of cups-browsed.
So any new development in CUPS&rsquo; PPD generator gets
available. As CUPS&rsquo; PPD generator is not directly
accessible, we need to make CUPS generate a temporary print
queue with the desired PPD. Therefore we can only use these
PPDs when our queue replaces a temporary CUPS queue, meaning
that the queue is for a printer on which CUPS supports
driverless printing (IPP 2.x, PDLs: PDF, PWG Raster, and/or
Apple Raster) and that its name is the same as CUPS uses for
the temporary queue (&quot;LocalQueueNamingIPPPrinter
DNS-SD&quot; must be set). The directive applies only to IPP
printers, not to remote CUPS queues, to not break
clustering. Setting this directive to &quot;No&quot; lets
cups-browsed generate the PPD file. Default setting is
&quot;No&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">UseCUPSGeneratedPPDs
No</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the
directives LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS and
LocalQueueNamingIPPPrinter you can determine how the names
for local queues generated by cups-browsed are generated,
separately for remote CUPS printers and IPP printers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;DNS-SD&quot;
(the default in both cases) bases the naming on the service
name of the printer&rsquo;s advertised DNS-SD record. This
is exactly the same naming scheme as CUPS uses for its
temporary queues, so the local queue from cups-browsed
prevents CUPS from listing and creating an additional queue.
As DNS-SD service names have to be unique, queue names of
printers from different servers will also be unique and so
there is no automatic clustering for load-balanced
printing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;MakeModel&quot;
bases the queue name on the printer&rsquo;s manufacturer and
model names. This scheme cups-browsed used formerly for IPP
printers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;RemoteName&quot;
is only available for remote CUPS queues and uses the name
of the queue on the remote CUPS server as the local
queue&rsquo;s name. This makes printers on different CUPS
servers with equal queue names automatically forming a
load-balancing cluster as CUPS did formerly (CUPS 1.5.x and
older) with CUPS-broadcasted remote printers. This scheme
cups-browsed used formerly for remote CUPS printers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Set
DNSSDBasedDeviceURIs to &quot;Yes&quot; if cups-browsed
should use DNS-SD-service-name-based device URIs for its
local queues, as CUPS also does. These queues use the DNS-SD
service name of the discovered printer. With this the URI is
independent of network interfaces and ports, giving reliable
connections to always the same physical device. This setting
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Set
DNSSDBasedDeviceURIs to &quot;No&quot; if cups-browsed
should use the conventional host-name/IP-based URIs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
option has only influence on URIs for printers discovered
via DNS-SD, not via legacy CUPS broewsing or LDAP. Those
printers get always assigned the conventional URIs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DNSSDBasedDeviceURIs
Yes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Set

addresses instead of the host names of the remote servers.
This mode is there for any problems with host name
resolution in the network, especially also if avahi-daemon
is only run for printer discovery and already stopped while
still printing. By default this mode is turned off, meaning
that we use URIs with host names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
IP addresses depend on the network interface through which
the printer is accessed. So do not use IP-based URIs on
systems with many network interfaces and where interfaces
can appear and disappear frequently.</p>

CreateRemoteRawPrinterQueues to &quot;Yes&quot; to let
cups-browsed also create local queues pointing to remote raw
CUPS queues. Normally, only queues pointing to remote queues
with PPD/driver are created as we do not use drivers on the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How to handle
the print queues cups-browsed creates when cups-browsed is
shut down:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;KeepGeneratedQueuesOnShutdown
No&quot; makes the queues being removed. This makes sense as
these queues only work while cups-browsed is running.
cups-browsed has to determine to which member printer of a
cluster to pass on the job.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;KeepGeneratedQueuesOnShutdown
Yes&quot; (the default) makes the queues not being removed.
This is the recommended setting for a system where
cups-browsed is permanently running and only stopped for
short times (like log rotation) or on shutdown. This avoids
the re-creation of the queues when cups-browsed is
restarted, which often causes a clutter of CUPS
notifications on the desktop.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">KeepGeneratedQueuesOnShutdown
No</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there is
more than one remote CUPS printer whose local queue would
get the same name and AutoClustering is set to
&quot;Yes&quot; (the default) only one local queue is
created which makes up a load-balancing cluster of the
remote printers which would get this queue name (implicit
class). This means that when several jobs are sent to this
queue they get distributed between the printers, using the
method chosen by the LoadBalancing directive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
forming of clusters depends on the naming scheme for local
queues created by cups-browsed. If you have set
LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS to &quot;DNSSD&quot; you will not
get automatic clustering as the DNS-SD service names are
always unique. With LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS set to
&quot;RemoteName&quot; local queues are named as the CUPS
queues on the remote servers are named and so equally named
queues on different servers get clustered (this is how CUPS
did it in version 1.5.x or older).
LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS set to &quot;MakeModel&quot;
makes remote printers of the same model get clustered. Note
that then a cluster can contain more than one queue of the
same server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With
AutoClustering set to &quot;No&quot;, for each remote CUPS
printer an individual local queue is created, and to avoid
name clashes when using the LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS
settings &quot;RemoteName&quot; or &quot;MakeModel&quot;
&quot;@&lt;server name&gt;&quot; is added to the local queue
name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only remote
CUPS printers get clustered, not IPP network printers or
IPP-over-USB printers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AutoClustering
Yes <br>
AutoClustering No</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Load-balancing
printer cluster formation can also be manually controlled by
defining explicitly which remote CUPS printers should get
clustered together.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is done by
the &quot;Cluster&quot; directive:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Cluster
&lt;QUEUENAME&gt;: &lt;EXPRESSION1&gt; &lt;EXPRESSION2&gt;
... <br>
Cluster &lt;QUEUENAME&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no
expressions are given, &lt;QUEUENAME&gt; is used as the
first and only expression for this cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Discovered
printers are matched against all the expressions of all
defined clusters. The first expression which matches the
discovered printer determines to which cluster it belongs.
Note that this way a printer can only belong to one cluster.
Once matched, further cluster definitions will not checked
any more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the first
printer matching a cluster&rsquo;s expression a local queue
with the name &lt;QUEUENAME&gt; is created. If more printers
are discovered and match this cluster, they join the
cluster. Printing to this queue prints to all these printers
in a load-balancing manner, according to to the setting of
the LoadBalancing directive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each expression
must be a string of characters without spaces. If spaces are
needed, replace them by underscores (&rsquo;_&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An expression
can be matched in three ways:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. By the name
of the CUPS queue on the remote server <br>
2. By make and model name of the remote printer <br>
3. By the DNS-SD service name of the remote printer</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
matching is done case-insensitively and any group of
non-alphanumerical characters is replaced by a single
underscore.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So if an
expression is &quot;HP_DeskJet_2540&quot; and the remote
server reports &quot;hp Deskjet-2540&quot; the printer gets
matched to this cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;AutoClustering&quot; is not set to &quot;No&quot; both
your manual cluster definitions will be followed and
automatic clustering of equally-named remote queues will be
performed. If a printer matches in both categories the match
to the manually defined cluster has priority. Automatic
clustering of equally-named remote printers is not performed
if there is a manually defined cluster with this name (at
least as the printers do not match this cluster).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To cluster all
remote CUPS queues named &quot;laserprinter&quot; in your

CUPS printers use (Local queue will get named

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To cluster all

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Cluster LJ4050:
HP_LaserJet_4050</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As DNS-SD
service names are unique in a network you can create a
cluster from exactly specified printers (spaces replaced by
underscores):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Cluster hrdep:
oldlaser_@_hr-server1 newlaser_@_hr-server2</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
LoadBalancing directive switches between two methods of
handling load balancing between equally-named remote queues
which are represented by one local print queue making up a
cluster of them (implicit class).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The two methods
are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Queuing of jobs
on the client (LoadBalancing QueueOnClient):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here we queue
up the jobs on the client and regularly check the clustered
remote print queues. If we find an idle queue, we pass on a
job to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is also
the method which CUPS uses for classes. Advantage is a more
even distribution of the job workload on the servers
(especially if the printing speed of the servers is very
different), and if a server fails, there are not several
jobs stuck or lost. Disadvantage is that if one takes the
client (laptop, mobile phone, ...) out of the local network,
printing stops with the jobs waiting in the local queue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Queuing of jobs
on the servers (LoadBalancing QueueOnServers):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here we check
the number of jobs on each of the clustered remote printers
and send an incoming job immediately to the remote printer
with the lowest amount of jobs in its queue. This way no
jobs queue up locally, all jobs which are waiting are
waiting on one of the remote servers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not having jobs
waiting locally has the advantage that we can take the local
machine from the network and all jobs get printed.
Disadvantage is that if a server with a full queue of jobs
goes away, the jobs go away, too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Default is
queuing the jobs on the client as this is what CUPS does
with classes.</p>

options with the &quot;-o&quot; command line argument to the
&quot;lpadmin&quot; command (Run &quot;man lpadmin&quot; for
more details). More than one option can be supplied
separating the options by spaces. By default no option

automatically terminate when it has no local raw queues set
up pointing to any discovered remote printers or no jobs on
such queues depending on AutoShutdownOn setting (auto

auto-shutdown mode, setting it to &quot;Off&quot;
deactivates it (the default). The special mode
&quot;avahi&quot; turns auto shutdown off while avahi-daemon
