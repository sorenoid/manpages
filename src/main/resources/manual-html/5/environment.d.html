Definition of user service environment</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">~/.config/environment.d/*.conf</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/etc/environment.d/*.conf</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Configuration
files in the environment.d/ directories contain lists of
environment variable assignments for services started by the
systemd user instance.
<b>systemd-environment-d-generator</b>(8) parses them and
updates the environment exported by the systemd user
instance. See below for an discussion of which processes
inherit those variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
recommended to use numerical prefixes for file names to
simplify ordering.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For backwards
compatibility, a symlink to /etc/environment is installed,
so this file is also parsed.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
<a name="CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Configuration
files are read from directories in /etc/, /run/,
/usr/local/lib/, and /lib/, in order of precedence, as
listed in the SYNOPSIS section above. Files must have the
&quot;.conf&quot; extension. Files in /etc/ override files
with the same name in /run/, /usr/local/lib/, and /lib/.
Files in /run/ override files with the same name under
/usr/.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All
configuration files are sorted by their filename in
lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories
they reside in. If multiple files specify the same option,
the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name
will take precedence. Thus, the configuration in a certain
file may either be replaced completely (by placing a file
with the same name in a directory with higher priority), or
individual settings might be changed (by specifying
additional settings in a file with a different name that is
ordered later).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Packages should
install their configuration files in /usr/lib/ (distribution
packages) or /usr/local/lib/ (local installs). Files in
/etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may use
this logic to override the configuration files installed by
vendor packages. It is recommended to prefix all filenames
with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering
of the files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied
by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with the
same filename as the vendor configuration file. If the
vendor configuration file is included in the initrd image,
the image has to be regenerated.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION FORMAT
<a name="CONFIGURATION FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
configuration files contain a list of
&quot;<i>KEY</i>=<i>VALUE</i>&quot; environment variable
assignments, separated by newlines. The right hand side of
these assignments may reference previously defined
environment variables, using the &quot;${OTHER_KEY}&quot;
and &quot;$OTHER_KEY&quot; format. It is also possible to
use &quot;${<i>FOO</i>:-<i>DEFAULT_VALUE</i>}&quot; to
expand in the same way as &quot;${<i>FOO</i>}&quot; unless
the expansion would be empty, in which case it expands to
<i>DEFAULT_VALUE</i>, and use
&quot;${<i>FOO</i>:+<i>ALTERNATE_VALUE</i>}&quot; to expand
to <i>ALTERNATE_VALUE</i> as long as
&quot;${<i>FOO</i>}&quot; would have expanded to a non-empty
value. No other elements of shell syntax are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each <i>KEY</i>
must be a valid variable name. Empty lines and lines
beginning with the comment character &quot;#&quot; are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example <br>
Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Setup environment to allow access to a
program installed in /opt/foo</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/etc/environment.d/60-foo.conf:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">FOO_DEBUG=force-software-gl,log-verbose
<br>
PATH=/opt/foo/bin:$PATH <br>

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/foo/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
<br>

XDG_DATA_DIRS=/opt/foo/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/}</p>

<h2>APPLICABILITY
<a name="APPLICABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Environment
variables exported by the user manager (<b>systemd
--user</b> instance started in the user@<i>uid</i>.service
system service) apply to any services started by that
manager. In particular, this may include services which run
user shells. For example in the GNOME environment, the
graphical terminal emulator runs as the
gnome-terminal-server.service user unit, which in turn runs
the user shell, so that shell will inherit environment
variables exported by the user manager. For other instances
of the shell, not launched by the user manager, the
environment they inherit is defined by the program that
starts them. Hint: in general, <b>systemd.service</b>(5)
units contain programs launched by systemd, and
<b>systemd.scope</b>(5) units contain programs launched by
something else.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Specifically,
for ssh logins, the <b>sshd</b>(8) service builds an
environment that is a combination of variables forwarded
from the remote system and defined by <b>sshd</b>, see the
discussion in <b>ssh</b>(1). A graphical display session
will have an analogous mechanism to define the environment.
Note that some managers query the systemd user instance for
the exported environment and inject this configuration into
programs they start, using <b>systemctl show-environment</b>
or the underlying D-Bus call.</p>
