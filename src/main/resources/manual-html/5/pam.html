arbitrary map file format</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PAM image
format is a lowest common denominator 2 dimensional map
format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is designed
to be used for any of myriad kinds of graphics, but can
theoretically be used for any kind of data that is arranged
as a two dimensional rectangular array. Actually, from
another perspective it can be seen as a format for data
arranged as a three dimensional array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This format
does not define the meaning of the data at any particular
point in the array. It could be red, green, and blue light
intensities such that the array represents a visual image,
or it could be the same red, green, and blue components plus
a transparency component, or it could contain annual
rainfalls for places on the surface of the Earth. Any
process that uses the PAM format must further define the
format to specify the meanings of the data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A PAM image
describes a two dimensional grid of tuples. The tuples are
arranged in rows and columns. The width of the image is the
number of columns. The height of the image is the number of
rows. All rows are the same width and all columns are the
same height. The tuples may have any degree, but all tuples
have the same degree. The degree of the tuples is called the
depth of the image. Each member of a tuple is called a
sample. A sample is an unsigned integer which represents a
locus along a scale which starts at zero and ends at a
certain maximum value greater than zero called the maxval.
The maxval is the same for every sample in the image. The
two dimensional array of all the Nth samples of each tuple
is called the Nth plane or Nth channel of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Though the
format does not assign any meaning to the tuple values, it
does include an optional string that describes that meaning.
The contents of this string, called the tuple type, are
arbitrary from the point of view of the PAM format, but
users of the format may assign meaning to it by convention
so they can identify their particular implementations of the
PAM format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
Layout</b> <br>
A PAM file consists of a sequence of one or more PAM images.
There are no data, delimiters, or padding before, after, or
between images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each PAM image
consists of a header followed immediately by a raster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
example header:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>P7 <br>
WIDTH 227 <br>
HEIGHT 149 <br>
DEPTH 3 <br>
MAXVAL 255 <br>
TUPLTYPE RGB <br>
ENDHDR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The header
begins with the ASCII characters &quot;P7&quot; followed by
newline. This is the magic number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The header
continues with an arbitrary number of lines of ASCII text.
Each line ends with and is delimited by a newline
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each header
line consists of zero or more whitespace-delimited tokens or
begins with &quot;#&quot;. If it begins with &quot;#&quot;
it is a comment and the rest of this specification does not
apply to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A header line
which has zero tokens is valid but has no meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type of
header line is identified by its first token, which is 8
characters or less:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>ENDHDR</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This is the last line in the header. The header must
contain exactly one of these header lines.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>HEIGHT</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The second token is a decimal number representing the
height of the image (number of rows). The header must
contain exactly one of these header lines.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>WIDTH</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The second token is a decimal number representing the
width of the image (number of columns). The header must
contain exactly one of these header lines.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>DEPTH</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The second token is a decimal number representing the
depth of the image (number of planes or channels). The
header must contain exactly one of these header lines.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>MAXVAL</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The second token is a decimal number representing the
maxval of the image. The header must contain exactly one of
these header lines.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TUPLTYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The header may contain any
number of these header lines, including zero. The rest of
the line is part of the tuple type. The rest of the line is
not tokenized, but the tuple type does not include any white
space immediately following <b>TUPLTYPE</b> or at the very
end of the line. It does not include a newline. If there are
multiple <b>TUPLTYPE</b> header lines, the tuple type is the
concatenation of the values from each of them, separated by
a single blank, in the order in which they appear in the
header. If there are no <b>TUPLTYPE</b> header lines the
tuple type is the null string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The raster
consists of each row of the image, in order from top to
bottom, consecutive with no delimiter of any kind between,
before, or after, rows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each row
consists of every tuple in the row, in order from left to
right, consecutive with no delimiter of any kind between,
before, or after, tuples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each tuple
consists of every sample in the tuple, in order, consecutive
with no delimiter of any kind between, before, or after,
samples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each sample
consists of an unsigned integer in pure binary format, with
the most significant byte first. The number of bytes is the
minimum number of bytes required to represent the maxval of
the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PAM Used For
PNM (PBM, PGM, or PPM) Images</b> <br>
A common use of PAM images is to represent the older and
more concrete PBM, PGM, and PPM images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A PBM image is
conventionally represented as a PAM image of depth 1 with
maxval 1 where the one sample in each tuple is 0 to
represent a black pixel and 1 to represent a white one. The
height, width, and raster bear the obvious relationship to
those of the PBM image. The tuple type for PBM images
represented as PAM images is conventionally
&quot;BLACKANDWHITE&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A PGM image is
conventionally represented as a PAM image of depth 1. The
maxval, height, width, and raster bear the obvious
relationship to those of the PGM image. The tuple type for
PGM images represented as PAM images is conventionally
&quot;GRAYSCALE&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A PPM image is
conventionally represented as a PAM image of depth 3. The
maxval, height, width, and raster bear the obvious
relationship to those of the PPM image. The first plane
represents red, the second green, and the third blue. The
tuple type for PPM images represented as PAM images is
conventionally &quot;RGB&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
Confusing Universe of Netpbm Formats</b> <br>
It is easy to get confused about the relationship between
the PAM format and PBM, PGM, PPM, and PNM. Here is a little
enlightenment:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;PNM&quot;
is not really a format. It is a shorthand for the PBM, PGM,
and PPM formats collectively. It is also the name of a group
of library functions that can each handle all three of those
formats.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;PAM&quot;
is in fact a fourth format. But it is so general that you
can represent the same information in a PAM image as you can
in a PBM, PGM, or PPM image. And in fact a program that is
designed to read PBM, PGM, or PPM and does so with a recent
version of the Netpbm library, will read an equivalent PAM
image just fine and the program will never know the
difference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To confuse
things more, there is a collection of library routines
called the &quot;pam&quot; functions that read and write the
PAM format, but also read and write the PBM, PGM, and PPM
formats. They do this because the latter formats are much
older and more popular, so this makes it convenient to write
programs that use the newer PAM format.</p>
