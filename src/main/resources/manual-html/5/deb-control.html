</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">deb-control -
Debian binary packages&rsquo; master control file format</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>DEBIAN/control</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each Debian
binary package contains a <b>control</b> file in its
<b>control</b> member, and its <b>deb822</b>(5) format is a
subset of the master <b>debian/control</b> file in Debian
source packages, see <b>deb-src-control</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This file
contains a number of fields. Each field begins with a tag,
such as <b>Package</b> or <b>Version</b> (case insensitive),
followed by a colon, and the body of the field (case
sensitive unless stated otherwise). Fields are delimited
only by field tags. In other words, field text may be
multiple lines in length, but the installation tools will
generally join lines when processing the body of the field
(except in the case of the <b>Description</b> field, see
below).</p>

<h2>FIELDS
<a name="FIELDS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Package:</b>
<i>package-name</i> (required)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The value of this field
determines the package name, and is used to generate file
names by most installation tools.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Package-Type:
deb</b>|<b>udeb</b>|<i>type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This field defines the type of
the package. <b>udeb</b> is for size-constrained packages
used by the debian installer. <b>deb</b> is the default
value, it is assumed if the field is absent. More types
might be added in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Version:</b>
<i>version-string</i> (required)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Typically, this is the original
package&rsquo;s version number in whatever form the
program&rsquo;s author uses. It may also include a Debian
revision number (for non-native packages). The exact format
and sorting algorithm are described in
<b>deb-version</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Maintainer:</b>
<i>fullname-email</i> (recommended)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Should be in the format
&ldquo;Joe Bloggs &lt;jbloggs@foo.com&gt;&rdquo;, and is
typically the person who created the package, as opposed to
the author of the software that was packaged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Description:</b>
<i>short-description</i> (recommended) <i><br>
long-description</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The format for the package
description is a short brief summary on the first line
(after the <b>Description</b> field). The following lines
should be used as a longer, more detailed description. Each
line of the long description must be preceded by a space,
and blank lines in the long description must contain a
single &rsquo;<b>.</b>&rsquo; following the preceding
space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Section:</b>
<i>section</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a general field that
gives the package a category based on the software that it
installs. Some common sections are <b>utils</b>, <b>net</b>,
<b>mail</b>, <b>text</b>, <b>x11</b>, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Priority:</b>
<i>priority</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the importance of this
package in relation to the system as a whole. Common
priorities are <b>required</b>, <b>standard</b>,
<b>optional</b>, <b>extra</b>, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Section</b> and <b>Priority</b> fields usually have a
defined set of accepted values based on the specific
distribution policy. <b><br>
Installed-Size:</b> <i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The approximate total size of
the package&rsquo;s installed files, in KiB units. The
algorithm to compute the size is described in
<b>deb-substvars</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Protected:
yes</b>|<b>no</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This field is usually only
needed when the answer is <b>yes</b>. It denotes a package
that is required for proper booting of the system.
<b>dpkg</b>(1) or any other installation tool will not allow
a <b>Protected</b> package to be removed (at least not
without using one of the force options).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Supported since
dpkg 1.20.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Essential:
yes</b>|<b>no</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This field is usually only
needed when the answer is <b>yes</b>. It denotes a package
that is required for proper operation of the system.
<b>dpkg</b>(1) or any other installation tool will not allow
an <b>Essential</b> package to be removed (at least not
without using one of the force options).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Build-Essential:
yes</b>|<b>no</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This field is usually only
needed when the answer is <b>yes</b>, and is commonly
injected by the archive software. It denotes a package that
is required when building other packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Architecture:</b>
<i>arch</i>|<b>all</b> (required)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The architecture specifies
which type of hardware this package was compiled for. Common
architectures are <b>amd64</b>, <b>armel</b>, <b>i386</b>,
<b>powerpc</b>, etc. Note that the <b>all</b> value is meant
for packages that are architecture independent. Some
examples of this are shell and Perl scripts, and
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Origin:</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the distribution
this package is originating from.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Bugs:</b> <i>url</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <i>url</i> of the bug
tracking system for this package. The current used format is
<i>bts-type</i><b>://</b><i>bts-address</i>, like
<b>debbugs://bugs.debian.org</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Homepage:</b> <i>url</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The upstream project home page
<i>url</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Tag:</b> <i>tag-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List of tags describing the
qualities of the package. The description and list of
supported tags can be found in the <b>debtags</b>
package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Multi-Arch:
no</b>|<b>same</b>|<b>foreign</b>|<b>allowed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This field is used to indicate
how this package should behave on a multi-arch
installations.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>no</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>This value is the default when the field is omitted, in
which case adding the field with an explicit <b>no</b> value
is generally not needed.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><b>same</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This package is co-installable
with itself, but it must not be used to satisfy the
dependency of any package of a different architecture from
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><b>foreign</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This package is not
co-installable with itself, but should be allowed to satisfy
a non-arch-qualified dependency of a package of a different
arch from itself (if a dependency has an explicit
arch-qualifier then the value <b>foreign</b> is
ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><b>allowed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This allows
reverse-dependencies to indicate in their <b>Depends</b>
field that they accept this package from a foreign
architecture by qualifying the package name with
<b>:any</b>, but has no effect otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Source:</b>
<i>source-name</i>
[<b>(</b><i>source-version</i><b>)</b>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the source package
that this binary package came from, if it is different than
the name of the package itself. If the source version
differs from the binary version, then the <i>source-name</i>
will be followed by a <i>source-version</i> in parenthesis.
This can happen for example on a binary-only non-maintainer
upload, or when setting a different binary version via
&laquo;<b>dpkg-gencontrol -v</b>&raquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Subarchitecture:</b>
<i>value</i> <b><br>
Kernel-Version:</b> <i>value</i> <b><br>
Installer-Menu-Item:</b> <i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These fields are used by the
debian-installer and are usually not needed. See
/usr/share/doc/debian-installer/devel/modules.txt from the
<b>debian-installer</b> package for more details about
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Depends:</b>
<i>package-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List of packages that are
required for this package to provide a non-trivial amount of
functionality. The package maintenance software will not
allow a package to be installed if the packages listed in
its <b>Depends</b> field aren&rsquo;t installed (at least
not without using the force options). In an installation,
the postinst scripts of packages listed in <b>Depends</b>
fields are run before those of the packages which depend on
them. On the opposite, in a removal, the prerm script of a
package is run before those of the packages listed in its
<b>Depends</b> field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Pre-Depends:</b>
<i>package-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List of packages that must be
installed <b>and</b> configured before this one can be
installed. This is usually used in the case where this
package requires another package for running its preinst
script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Recommends:</b>
<i>package-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Lists packages that would be
found together with this one in all but unusual
installations. The package maintenance software will warn
the user if they install a package without those listed in
its <b>Recommends</b> field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Suggests:</b>
<i>package-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Lists packages that are related
to this one and can perhaps enhance its usefulness, but
without which installing this package is perfectly
reasonable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of
<b>Depends</b>, <b>Pre-Depends</b>, <b>Recommends</b> and
<b>Suggests</b> fields is a list of groups of alternative
packages. Each group is a list of packages separated by
vertical bar (or &ldquo;pipe&rdquo;) symbols,
&rsquo;<b>|</b>&rsquo;. The groups are separated by commas.
Commas are to be read as &ldquo;AND&rdquo;, and pipes as
&ldquo;OR&rdquo;, with pipes binding more tightly. Each
package name is optionally followed by an architecture
qualifier appended after a colon &rsquo;<b>:</b>&rsquo;,
optionally followed by a version number specification in
parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An architecture
qualifier name can be a real Debian architecture name (since
dpkg 1.16.5) or <b>any</b> (since dpkg 1.16.2). If omitted,
the default is the current binary package architecture. A
real Debian architecture name will match exactly that
architecture for that package name, <b>any</b> will match
any architecture for that package name if the package has
been marked as <b>Multi-Arch: allowed</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A version
number may start with a &rsquo;<b>&gt;&gt;</b>&rsquo;, in
which case any later version will match, and may specify or
omit the Debian packaging revision (separated by a hyphen).
Accepted version relationships are
&rsquo;<b>&gt;&gt;</b>&rsquo; for greater than,
&rsquo;<b>&lt;&lt;</b>&rsquo; for less than,
&rsquo;<b>&gt;=</b>&rsquo; for greater than or equal to,
&rsquo;<b>&lt;=</b>&rsquo; for less than or equal to, and
&rsquo;<b>=</b>&rsquo; for equal to. <b><br>
Breaks:</b> <i>package-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Lists packages that this one
breaks, for example by exposing bugs when the named packages
rely on this one. The package maintenance software will not
allow broken packages to be configured; generally the
resolution is to upgrade the packages named in a
<b>Breaks</b> field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Conflicts:</b>
<i>package-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Lists packages that conflict
with this one, for example by containing files with the same
names. The package maintenance software will not allow
conflicting packages to be installed at the same time. Two
conflicting packages should each include a <b>Conflicts</b>
line mentioning the other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Replaces:</b>
<i>package-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List of packages files from
which this one replaces. This is used for allowing this
package to overwrite the files of another package and is
usually used with the <b>Conflicts</b> field to force
removal of the other package, if this one also has the same
files as the conflicted package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of
<b>Breaks</b>, <b>Conflicts</b> and <b>Replaces</b> is a
list of package names, separated by commas (and optional
whitespace). In the <b>Breaks</b> and <b>Conflicts</b>
fields, the comma should be read as &ldquo;OR&rdquo;. An
optional architecture qualifier can also be appended to the
package name with the same syntax as above, but the default
is <b>any</b> instead of the binary package architecture. An
optional version can also be given with the same syntax as
above for the <b>Breaks</b>, <b>Conflicts</b> and
<b>Replaces</b> fields. <b><br>
Enhances:</b> <i>package-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a list of packages that
this one enhances. It is similar to <b>Suggests</b> but in
the opposite direction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Provides:</b>
<i>package-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a list of virtual
packages that this one provides. Usually this is used in the
case of several packages all providing the same service. For
example, sendmail and exim can serve as a mail server, so
they provide a common package
(&ldquo;mail-transport-agent&rdquo;) on which other packages
can depend. This will allow sendmail or exim to serve as a
valid option to satisfy the dependency. This prevents the
packages that depend on a mail server from having to know
the package names for all of them, and using
&rsquo;<b>|</b>&rsquo; to separate the list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of
<b>Provides</b> is a list of package names, separated by
commas (and optional whitespace). An optional architecture
qualifier can also be appended to the package name with the
same syntax as above. If omitted, the default is the current
binary package architecture. An optional exact (equal to)
version can also be given with the same syntax as above
(honored since dpkg 1.17.11). <b><br>
Built-Using:</b> <i>package-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This field lists extra source
packages that were used during the build of this binary
package. This is an indication to the archive maintenance
software that these extra source packages must be kept
whilst this binary package is maintained. This field must be
a list of source package names with strict
&rsquo;<b>=</b>&rsquo; version relationships. Note that the
archive maintenance software is likely to refuse to accept
an upload which declares a <b>Built-Using</b> relationship
which cannot be satisfied within the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Built-For-Profiles:</b>
<i>profile-list</i> (obsolete)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This field used to specify a
whitespace separated list of build profiles that this binary
packages was built with (since dpkg 1.17.2 until 1.18.18).
The information previously found in this field can now be
found in the <b>.buildinfo</b> file, which supersedes
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Auto-Built-Package:</b>
<i>reason-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This field specifies a
whitespace separated list of reasons why this package was
auto-generated. Binary packages marked with this field will
not appear in the <i>debian/control</i> master source
control file. The only currently used reason is
<b>debug-symbols</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Build-Ids:</b>
<i>elf-build-id-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This field specifies a
whitespace separated list of <small>ELF</small> build-ids.
These are unique identifiers for semantically identical
<small>ELF</small> objects, for each of these within the
package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The format or
the way to compute each build-id is not defined by
design.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Package: grep
<br>
Essential: yes <br>
Priority: required <br>
Section: base <br>
Maintainer: Wichert Akkerman &lt;wakkerma@debian.org&gt;
<br>
Architecture: sparc <br>
Version: 2.4-1 <br>
Pre-Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.0.105) <br>
Provides: rgrep <br>
Conflicts: rgrep <br>
Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep. <br>
The GNU family of grep utilities may be the &quot;fastest
grep in the west&quot;. <br>
GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher
(about <br>
twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a
Boyer-Moore-Gosper <br>
search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text
from being <br>
considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily
having to <br>
look at every character. The result is typically many times
faster <br>
than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing
backreferencing <br>
will run more slowly, however).</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Build-Ids</b> field uses a rather generic name out of its
original context within an <small>ELF</small> object, which
serves a very specific purpose and executable format.</p>
