<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">apt_preferences
- Preference control file for APT</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The APT
preferences file /etc/apt/preferences and the fragment files
in the /etc/apt/preferences.d/ folder can be used to control
which versions of packages will be selected for
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several
versions of a package may be available for installation when
the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file contains references to more
than one distribution (for example, stable and testing). APT
assigns a priority to each version that is available.
Subject to dependency constraints, <b>apt-get</b> selects
the version with the highest priority for installation. The
APT preferences override the priorities that APT assigns to
package versions by default, thus giving the user control
over which one is selected for installation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several
instances of the same version of a package may be available
when the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file contains references to
more than one source. In this case <b>apt-get</b> downloads
the instance listed earliest in the <b>sources.list</b>(5)
file. The APT preferences do not affect the choice of
instance, only the choice of version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Preferences are
a strong power in the hands of a system administrator but
they can become also their biggest nightmare if used without
care! APT will not question the preferences, so wrong
settings can lead to uninstallable packages or wrong
decisions while upgrading packages. Even more problems will
arise if multiple distribution releases are mixed without a
good understanding of the following paragraphs. Packages
included in a specific release aren't tested in (and
therefore don't always work as expected in) older or newer
releases, or together with other packages from different
releases. You have been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
files in the /etc/apt/preferences.d directory are parsed in
alphanumeric ascending order and need to obey the following
naming convention: The files have either no or
&quot;pref&quot; as filename extension and only contain
alphanumeric, hyphen (-), underscore (_) and period (.)
characters. Otherwise APT will print a notice that it has
ignored a file, unless that file matches a pattern in the
Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently configuration list - in which
case it will be silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>APT's
Default Priority Assignments</b> <br>
If there is no preferences file or if there is no entry in
the file that applies to a particular version then the
priority assigned to that version is the priority of the
distribution to which that version belongs. It is possible
to single out a distribution, &quot;the target
release&quot;, which receives a higher priority than other
distributions do by default. The target release can be set
on the <b>apt-get</b> command line or in the APT
configuration file /etc/apt/apt.conf. Note that this has
precedence over any general priority you set in the
/etc/apt/preferences file described later, but not over
specifically pinned packages. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>apt-get
install -t testing</b> <i>some-package</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">APT::Default-Release
&quot;stable&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the target
release has been specified then APT uses the following
algorithm to set the priorities of the versions of a
package. Assign:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">priority 1</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">to the versions coming from
archives which in their Release files are marked as
&quot;NotAutomatic: yes&quot; but <i>not</i> as
&quot;ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes&quot; like the Debian
experimental archive, as well as versions that are not
phased on this systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">priority
100</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">to the version that is already
installed (if any) and to the versions coming from archives
which in their Release files are marked as
&quot;NotAutomatic: yes&quot; and
&quot;ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes&quot; like the Debian
backports archive since squeeze-backports.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">priority
500</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">to the versions that do not
belong to the target release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">priority
990</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">to the versions that belong to
the target release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The highest of those priorities
whose description matches the version is assigned to the
version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the target
release has not been specified then APT simply assigns
priority 100 to all installed package versions and priority
500 to all uninstalled package versions, except versions
coming from archives which in their Release files are marked
as &quot;NotAutomatic: yes&quot; - these versions get the
priority 1 or priority 100 if it is additionally marked as
&quot;ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">APT then
applies the following rules, listed in order of precedence,
to determine which version of a package to install.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Never
downgrade unless the priority of an available version
exceeds 1000. (&quot;Downgrading&quot; is installing a less
recent version of a package in place of a more recent
version. Note that none of APT's default priorities exceeds
1000; such high priorities can only be set in the
preferences file. Note also that downgrading a package can
be risky.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Install
the highest priority version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If two
or more versions have the same priority, install the most
recent one (that is, the one with the higher version
number).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If two
or more versions have the same priority and version number
but either the packages differ in some of their metadata or
the --reinstall option is given, install the uninstalled
one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a typical
situation, the installed version of a package (priority 100)
is not as recent as one of the versions available from the
sources listed in the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file (priority
500 or 990). Then the package will be upgraded when
<b>apt-get install</b> <i>some-package</i> or <b>apt-get
upgrade</b> is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More rarely,
the installed version of a package is <i>more</i> recent
than any of the other available versions. The package will
not be downgraded when <b>apt-get install</b>
<i>some-package</i> or <b>apt-get upgrade</b> is
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes the
installed version of a package is more recent than the
version belonging to the target release, but not as recent
as a version belonging to some other distribution. Such a
package will indeed be upgraded when <b>apt-get install</b>
<i>some-package</i> or <b>apt-get upgrade</b> is executed,
because at least <i>one</i> of the available versions has a
higher priority than the installed version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Phased
Updates</b> <br>
APT understands a field called Phased-Update-Percentage
which can be used to control the rollout of a new version.
It is an integer between 0 and 100.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A system's
eligibility to a phased update is determined by seeding
random number generator with the package source name, the
version number, and /etc/machine-id, and then calculating an
integer in the range [0, 100]. If this integer is larger
than the Phased-Update-Percentage, the version is pinned to
1, and thus held back. Otherwise, normal policy rules
apply.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In case you
have multiple systems that you want to receive the same set
of updates, you can set APT::Machine-ID to a UUID such that
they all phase the same, or set
APT::Get::Never-Include-Phased-Updates or
APT::Get::Always-Include-Phased-Updates to true such that
APT will never/always consider phased updates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The Effect
of APT Preferences</b> <br>
The APT preferences file allows the system administrator to
control the assignment of priorities. The file consists of
one or more multi-line records separated by blank lines.
Records can have one of two forms, a specific form and a
general form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
specific form assigns a priority (a
&quot;Pin-Priority&quot;) to one or more specified packages
with a specified version or version range. For example, the
following record assigns a high priority to all versions of
the perl package whose version number begins with
&quot;5.20&quot;. Multiple packages can be separated by
spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Package: perl
<br>
Pin: version 5.20* <br>
Pin-Priority: 1001</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
general form assigns a priority to all of the package
versions in a given distribution (that is, to all the
versions of packages that are listed in a certain Release
file) or to all of the package versions coming from a
particular Internet site, as identified by the site's fully
qualified domain name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This
general-form entry in the APT preferences file applies only
to groups of packages. For example, the following record
assigns a high priority to all package versions available
from the local site.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Package: * <br>
Pin: origin &quot;&quot; <br>
Pin-Priority: 999</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A note of
caution: the keyword used here is &quot;origin&quot; which
can be used to match a hostname. The following record will
assign a high priority to all versions available from the
server identified by the hostname
&quot;ftp.de.debian.org&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Package: * <br>
Pin: origin &quot;ftp.de.debian.org&quot; <br>
Pin-Priority: 999</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This should
<i>not</i> be confused with the Origin of a distribution as
specified in a Release file. What follows the
&quot;Origin:&quot; tag in a Release file is not an Internet
address but an author or vendor name, such as
&quot;Debian&quot; or &quot;Ximian&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
record assigns a low priority to all package versions
belonging to any distribution whose Archive name is
&quot;unstable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Package: * <br>
Pin: release a=unstable <br>
Pin-Priority: 50</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
record assigns a high priority to all package versions
belonging to any distribution whose Codename is
&quot;bookworm&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Package: * <br>
Pin: release n=bookworm <br>
Pin-Priority: 900</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
record assigns a high priority to all package versions
belonging to any release whose Archive name is
&quot;stable&quot; and whose release Version number is
&quot;11&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Package: * <br>
Pin: release a=stable, v=11 <br>
Pin-Priority: 500</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The effect of
the comma operator is similar to an &quot;and&quot; in
logic: All conditions must be satisfied for the pin to
match. There is one exception: For any type of condition
(such as two &quot;a&quot; conditions), only the last such
condition is checked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Matching
packages in the Package field</b> <br>
The Package field specifies the package that a pinning
priority is applied to. The field can either contain a
binary package name, a source package name (prefixed with
&quot;src:&quot;), a <b>glob</b>(7) expression or a regular
expression (surrounded by slashes). Multiple package names,
<b>glob</b>(7) expressions and regular expressions can be
listed separated by whitespace in which case the record will
match any of the matched packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
only packages of the native architecture are matched. To
match binary packages of any architecture, add the :any
suffix to the package name. You can also limit matching to a
specific architecture by appending the architecture name to
the package name, separated by a colon character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the following example uses a glob expression and a regular
expression to assign the priority 500 to all packages from
experimental where the name starts with gnome (as a
<b>glob</b>(7)-like expression) or contains the word kde (as
a POSIX extended regular expression surrounded by
slashes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Package: gnome*
/kde/ <br>
Pin: release a=experimental <br>
Pin-Priority: 500</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The rule for
those expressions is that they can occur anywhere where a
string can occur. Thus, the following pin assigns the
priority 990 to all packages from a release starting with
hirsute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Package: * <br>
Pin: release n=hirsute* <br>
Pin-Priority: 990</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a regular
expression occurs in a Package field, the behavior is the
same as if this regular expression were replaced with a list
of all package names it matches. It is undecided whether
this will change in the future; thus you should always list
wild-card pins first, so later specific pins override it.
The pattern &quot;*&quot; in a Package field is not
considered a <b>glob</b>(7) expression in itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To pin all
binaries produced by the apt source package of this APT's
version to 990, you can do:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Package:
src:apt <br>
Pin: version 2.4.6 <br>
Pin-Priority: 990</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Source package
pinning can be combined with regular expressions and glob
patterns, and can also take a binary architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
let's pin all binaries for all architectures produced by any
source package containing apt in its name to 990:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Package:
src:*apt*:any <br>
Pin: version * <br>
Pin-Priority: 990</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The :any suffix
makes sure to select binary packages from any architecture.
Without that suffix, apt implicitly assumes the :native
suffix which would only select packages from the native
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How APT
Interprets Priorities</b> <br>
Priorities (P) assigned in the APT preferences file must be
positive or negative integers. They are interpreted as
follows (roughly speaking):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">P &gt;=
1000</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">causes a version to be
installed even if this constitutes a downgrade of the
package</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">990 &lt;= P
&lt; 1000</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">causes a version to be
installed even if it does not come from the target release,
unless the installed version is more recent</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">500 &lt;= P
&lt; 990</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">causes a version to be
installed unless there is a version available belonging to
the target release or the installed version is more
recent</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">100 &lt;= P
&lt; 500</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">causes a version to be
installed unless there is a version available belonging to
some other distribution or the installed version is more
recent</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">0 &lt; P &lt;
100</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">causes a version to be
installed only if there is no installed version of the
package</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">P &lt; 0</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">prevents the version from being
installed</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">P = 0</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">has undefined behaviour, do not
use it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
specific-form record matching an available package version
determines the priority of the package version. Failing
that, the priority of the package is defined as the maximum
of all priorities defined by generic-form records matching
the version. Records defined using patterns in the Pin field
other than &quot;*&quot; are treated like specific-form
records.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
suppose the APT preferences file contains the three records
presented earlier:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Package: perl
<br>
Pin: version 5.20* <br>
Pin-Priority: 1001</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Package: * <br>
Pin: origin &quot;&quot; <br>
Pin-Priority: 999</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Package: * <br>
Pin: release unstable <br>
Pin-Priority: 50</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The most
recent available version of the perl package will be
installed, so long as that version's version number begins
with &quot;5.20&quot;. If <i>any</i> 5.20* version of perl
is available and the installed version is 5.24*, then perl
will be downgraded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A
version of any package other than perl that is available
from the local system has priority over other versions, even
versions belonging to the target release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A
version of a package whose origin is not the local system
but some other site listed in <b>sources.list</b>(5) and
which belongs to an unstable distribution is only installed
if it is selected for installation and no version of the
package is already installed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Determination
of Package Version and Distribution Properties</b> <br>
The locations listed in the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file
should provide Packages and Release files to describe the
packages available at that location.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Packages
file is normally found in the directory
.../dists/<i>dist-name</i>/<i>component</i>/<i>arch</i>: for
example, .../dists/stable/main/binary-i386/Packages. It
consists of a series of multi-line records, one for each
package available in that directory. Only two lines in each
record are relevant for setting APT priorities:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the Package:
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">gives the package name</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the Version:
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">gives the version number for
the named package</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Release
file is normally found in the directory
.../dists/<i>dist-name</i>: for example,
.../dists/stable/Release, or .../dists/bullseye/Release. It
consists of a single multi-line record which applies to
<i>all</i> of the packages in the directory tree below its
parent. Unlike the Packages file, nearly all of the lines in
a Release file are relevant for setting APT priorities:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the Archive: or
Suite: line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">names the archive to which all
the packages in the directory tree belong. For example, the
line &quot;Archive: stable&quot; or &quot;Suite:
stable&quot; specifies that all of the packages in the
directory tree below the parent of the Release file are in a
stable archive. Specifying this value in the APT preferences
file would require the line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Pin: release
a=stable</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the Codename:
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">names the codename to which all
the packages in the directory tree belong. For example, the
line &quot;Codename: bookworm&quot; specifies that all of
the packages in the directory tree below the parent of the
Release file belong to a version named bookworm. Specifying
this value in the APT preferences file would require the
line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Pin: release
n=bookworm</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the Version:
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">names the release version. For
example, the packages in the tree might belong to Debian
release version 11. Note that there is normally no version
number for the testing and unstable distributions because
they have not been released yet. Specifying this in the APT
preferences file would require one of the following
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Pin: release
v=11 <br>
Pin: release a=stable, v=11 <br>
Pin: release 11</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the Component:
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">names the licensing component
associated with the packages in the directory tree of the
Release file. For example, the line &quot;Component:
main&quot; specifies that all the packages in the directory
tree are from the main component, which entails that they
are licensed under terms listed in the Debian Free Software
Guidelines. Specifying this component in the APT preferences
file would require the line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Pin: release
c=main</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the Origin:
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">names the originator of the
packages in the directory tree of the Release file. Most
commonly, this is Debian. Specifying this origin in the APT
preferences file would require the line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Pin: release
o=Debian</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the Label:
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">names the label of the packages
in the directory tree of the Release file. Most commonly,
this is Debian. Specifying this label in the APT preferences
file would require the line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Pin: release
l=Debian</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of the
Packages and Release files retrieved from locations listed
in the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file are stored in the
directory /var/lib/apt/lists, or in the file named by the
variable Dir::State::Lists in the apt.conf file. For
example, the file
debian.lcs.mit.edu_debian_dists_unstable_contrib_binary-i386_Release
contains the Release file retrieved from the site
debian.lcs.mit.edu for binary-i386 architecture files from
the contrib component of the unstable distribution.</p>

The following APT preferences file will cause APT to assign
a priority higher than the default (500) to all package
versions belonging to a specified codename of a distribution
and a prohibitively low priority to package versions
belonging to other Debian distributions, codenames and
archives. Note that with this APT preference APT will follow
the migration of a release from the archive testing to
stable and later oldstable. If you want to follow for
example the progress in testing notwithstanding the codename
changes you should use the example configurations above.</p>
