groff fonts for use with devlj4</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Nominally, all
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet&nbsp;4-series and newer printers
have the same internal fonts: 45 scalable fonts and one
bitmapped Lineprinter font. The scalable fonts are available
in sizes between 0.25 points and 999.75 points, in
0.25-point increments; the Lineprinter font is available
only in 8.5-point size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The LaserJet
font files included with <b>groff</b> assume that all
printers since the LaserJet&nbsp;4 are identical. There are
some differences between fonts in the earlier and more
recent printers, however. The LaserJet&nbsp;4 printer used
Agfa Intellifont technology for 35 of the internal scalable
fonts; the remaining 10 scalable fonts were TrueType.
Beginning with the LaserJet&nbsp;4000-series printers
introduced in 1997, all scalable internal fonts have been
TrueType. The number of printable glyphs differs slightly
between Intellifont and TrueType fonts (generally, the
TrueType fonts include more glyphs), and there are some
minor differences in glyph metrics. Differences among
printer models are described in the <i>PCL&nbsp;5 Comparison
Guide</i> and the <i>PCL&nbsp;5 Comparison Guide
Addendum</i> (for printers introduced since approximately
2001).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">LaserJet
printers reference a glyph by a combination of a 256-glyph
symbol set and an index within that symbol set. Many glyphs
appear in more than one symbol set; all combinations of
symbol set and index that reference the same glyph are
equivalent. For each glyph, <b>hpftodit</b>(1) searches a
list of symbol sets, and selects the first set that contains
the glyph. The printing code generated by <b>hpftodit</b> is
an integer that encodes a numerical value for the symbol set
in the high byte(s), and the index in the low byte. See
<b>groff_font</b>(5) for a complete description of the font
file format; symbol sets are described in greater detail in
the <i>PCL&nbsp;5 Printer Language Technical Reference
Manual</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two of the
scalable fonts, Symbol and Wingdings, are bound to 256-glyph
symbol sets; the remaining scalable fonts, as well as the
Lineprinter font, support numerous symbol sets, sufficient
to enable printing of more than 600 glyphs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The metrics
generated by <b>hpftodit</b> assume that the DESC file
contains values of 1200 for <i>res</i> and 6350 for
<i>unitwidth</i>, or any combination (e.g., 2400 and 3175)
for which
<i>res&nbsp;</i>&times;&nbsp;<i>unitwidth&nbsp;</i>=&nbsp;7620000.
Although HP PCL&nbsp;5 LaserJet printers support an internal
resolution of 7200 units per inch, they use a 16-bit signed
integer for cursor positioning; if <b>devlj4</b> is to
support U.S. ledger paper
(11&nbsp;in&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;17&nbsp;in; in = inch), the
maximum usable resolution is 32767&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;17, or
1927 units per inch, which rounds down to 1200 units per
inch. If the largest required paper size is less (e.g.,
8.5&nbsp;in&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;11&nbsp;in, or A5), a greater
<i>res</i> (and lesser <i>unitwidth</i>) can be
specified.</p>

<h2>LIMITATIONS
<a name="LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Font metrics
for Intellifont fonts were provided by Tagged Font Metric
(TFM) files originally developed by Agfa/Compugraphic. The
TFM files provided for these fonts supported 600+ glyphs and
contained extensive lists of kerning pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To accommodate
developers who had become accustomed to TFM files, HP also
provided TFM files for the 10 TrueType fonts included in the
LaserJet&nbsp;4. The TFM files for TrueType fonts generally
included less information than the Intellifont TFMs,
supporting fewer glyphs, and in most cases, providing no
kerning information. By the time the LaserJet&nbsp;4000
printer was introduced, most developers had migrated to
other means of obtaining font metrics, and support for new
TFM files was very limited. The TFM files provided for the
TrueType fonts in the LaserJet&nbsp;4000 support only the
Latin 2 (ISO 8859-2) symbol set, and include no kerning
information; consequently, they are of little value for any
but the most rudimentary documents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
Intellifont TFM files contain considerably more information,
they generally are preferable to the TrueType TFM files even
for use with the TrueType fonts in the newer printers. The
metrics for the TrueType fonts are very close, though not
identical, to those for the earlier Intellifont fonts of the
same names. Although most output using the Intellifont
metrics with the newer printers is quite acceptable, a few
glyphs may fail to print as expected. The differences in
glyph metrics may be particularly noticeable with composite
parentheses, brackets, and braces used by
<b>eqn</b>(1)<b>.</b> A script, located in
<i>/usr/share/groff/1.22.4/font/devlj4/generate</i>, can be
used to adjust the metrics for these glyphs in the special
font &ldquo;S&rdquo; for use with printers that have all
TrueType fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the time HP
last supported TFM files, only version 1.0 of the Unicode
standard was available. Consequently, many glyphs lacking
assigned code points were assigned by HP to the Private Use
Area (PUA). Later versions of the Unicode standard included
code points outside the PUA for many of these glyphs. The
HP-supplied TrueType TFM files use the PUA assignments; TFM
files generated from more recent TrueType font files require
the later Unicode values to access the same glyphs.
Consequently, two different mapping files may be required:
one for the HP-supplied TFM files, and one for more recent
TFM files.</p>
