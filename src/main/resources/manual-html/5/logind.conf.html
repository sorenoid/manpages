<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These files
configure various parameters of the systemd login manager,
<b>systemd-logind.service</b>(8). See
<b>systemd.syntax</b>(7) for a general description of the
syntax.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
<a name="CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is
only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those
defaults. Initially, the main configuration file in
/etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the
defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides
can be created by editing this file or by creating drop-ins,
as described below. Using drop-ins for local configuration
is recommended over modifications to the main configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the &quot;main&quot; configuration file, drop-in
configuration snippets are read from
/usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and
/etc/systemd/*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins have higher
precedence and override the main configuration file. Files
in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by
their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in
which of the subdirectories they reside. When multiple files
specify the same option, for options which accept just a
single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes
precedence, and for options which accept a list of values,
entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When packages
need to customize the configuration, they can install
drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins
have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended
to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a
two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To disable a
configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended
way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration
directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor
configuration file.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All options are
configured in the [Login] section:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>NAutoVTs=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a positive integer.
Configures how many virtual terminals (VTs) to allocate by
default that, when switched to and are previously unused,
&quot;autovt&quot; services are automatically spawned on.
These services are instantiated from the template unit
autovt@.service for the respective VT TTY name, for example,
autovt@tty4.service. By default, autovt@.service is linked
to getty@.service. In other words, login prompts are started
dynamically as the user switches to unused virtual
terminals. Hence, this parameter controls how many login
&quot;gettys&quot; are available on the VTs. If a VT is
already used by some other subsystem (for example, a
graphical login), this kind of activation will not be
attempted. Note that the VT configured in <i>ReserveVT=</i>
is always subject to this kind of activation, even if it is
not one of the VTs configured with the <i>NAutoVTs=</i>
directive. Defaults to 6. When set to 0, automatic spawning
of &quot;autovt&quot; services is disabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>ReserveVT=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a positive integer.
Identifies one virtual terminal that shall unconditionally
be reserved for autovt@.service activation (see above). The
VT selected with this option will be marked busy
unconditionally, so that no other subsystem will allocate
it. This functionality is useful to ensure that, regardless
of how many VTs are allocated by other subsystems, one login
&quot;getty&quot; is always available. Defaults to 6 (in
other words, there will always be a &quot;getty&quot;
available on Alt-F6.). When set to 0, VT reservation is
disabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>KillUserProcesses=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument.
Configures whether the processes of a user should be killed
when the user logs out. If true, the scope unit
corresponding to the session and all processes inside that
scope will be terminated. If false, the scope is
&quot;abandoned&quot;, see <b>systemd.scope</b>(5), and
processes are not killed. Defaults to &quot;no&quot;, but
see the options <i>KillOnlyUsers=</i> and
<i>KillExcludeUsers=</i> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
session processes, user process may run under the user
manager unit user@.service. Depending on the linger
settings, this may allow users to run processes independent
of their login sessions. See the description of
<b>enable-linger</b> in <a href="https://man.page/1/loginctl">loginctl(1)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
setting <i>KillUserProcesses=yes</i> will break tools like
<a href="https://man.page/1/screen">screen(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.page/1/tmux">tmux(1)</a>, unless they are moved
out of the session scope. See example in
<a href="https://man.page/1/systemd-run">systemd-run(1)</a>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>KillOnlyUsers=</i>,
<i>KillExcludeUsers=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These settings take
space-separated lists of usernames that override the
<i>KillUserProcesses=</i> setting. A user name may be added
to <i>KillExcludeUsers=</i> to exclude the processes in the
session scopes of that user from being killed even if
<i>KillUserProcesses=yes</i> is set. If
<i>KillExcludeUsers=</i> is not set, the &quot;root&quot;
user is excluded by default. <i>KillExcludeUsers=</i> may be
set to an empty value to override this default. If a user is
not excluded, <i>KillOnlyUsers=</i> is checked next. If this
setting is specified, only the processes in the session
scopes of those users will be killed. Otherwise, users are
subject to the <i>KillUserProcesses=yes</i> setting.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>IdleAction=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Configures the action to take
when the system is idle. Takes one of &quot;ignore&quot;,
&quot;poweroff&quot;, &quot;reboot&quot;, &quot;halt&quot;,
&quot;kexec&quot;, &quot;suspend&quot;,
&quot;hibernate&quot;, &quot;hybrid-sleep&quot;,
&quot;suspend-then-hibernate&quot;, and &quot;lock&quot;.
Defaults to &quot;ignore&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
requires that user sessions correctly report the idle status
to the system. The system will execute the action after all
sessions report that they are idle, no idle inhibitor lock
is active, and subsequently, the time configured with
<i>IdleActionSec=</i> (see below) has expired.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>IdleActionSec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Configures the delay after
which the action configured in <i>IdleAction=</i> (see
above) is taken after the system is idle.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>InhibitDelayMaxSec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the maximum time a
system shutdown or sleep request is delayed due to an
inhibitor lock of type &quot;delay&quot; being active before
the inhibitor is ignored and the operation executes anyway.
Defaults to 5.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>UserStopDelaySec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies how long to keep the
user record and per-user service user@.service around for a
user after they logged out fully. If set to zero, the
per-user service is terminated immediately when the last
session of the user has ended. If this option is configured
to non-zero rapid logout/login cycles are sped up, as the
user's service manager is not constantly restarted. If set
to &quot;infinity&quot; the per-user service for a user is
never terminated again after first login, and continues to
run until system shutdown. Defaults to 10s.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>HandlePowerKey=</i>,
<i>HandleSuspendKey=</i>, <i>HandleHibernateKey=</i>,
<i>HandleLidSwitch=</i>,
<i>HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=</i>,
<i>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</i>, <i>HandleRebootKey=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Controls how logind shall
handle the system power, reboot and sleep keys and the lid
switch to trigger actions such as system power-off, reboot
or suspend. Can be one of &quot;ignore&quot;,
&quot;poweroff&quot;, &quot;reboot&quot;, &quot;halt&quot;,
&quot;kexec&quot;, &quot;suspend&quot;,
&quot;hibernate&quot;, &quot;hybrid-sleep&quot;,
&quot;suspend-then-hibernate&quot;, and &quot;lock&quot;. If
&quot;ignore&quot;, logind will never handle these keys. If
&quot;lock&quot;, all running sessions will be
screen-locked; otherwise, the specified action will be taken
in the respective event. Only input devices with the
&quot;power-switch&quot; udev tag will be watched for
key/lid switch events. <i>HandlePowerKey=</i> defaults to
&quot;poweroff&quot;, <i>HandleRebootKey=</i> defaults to
&quot;reboot&quot;. <i>HandleSuspendKey=</i> and
<i>HandleLidSwitch=</i> default to &quot;suspend&quot;.
<i>HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=</i> is completely ignored
by default (for backwards compatibility) &mdash; an explicit
value must be set before it will be used to determine
behaviour. <i>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</i> defaults to
&quot;ignore&quot;. <i>HandleHibernateKey=</i> defaults to
&quot;hibernate&quot;. If the system is inserted in a
docking station, or if more than one display is connected,
the action specified by <i>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</i>
occurs; if the system is on external power the action (if
any) specified by <i>HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=</i>
occurs; otherwise the <i>HandleLidSwitch=</i> action
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A different
application may disable logind's handling of system power
and sleep keys and the lid switch by taking a low-level
inhibitor lock (&quot;handle-power-key&quot;,
&quot;handle-suspend-key&quot;,
&quot;handle-hibernate-key&quot;,
&quot;handle-lid-switch&quot;,
&quot;handle-reboot-switch&quot;). This is most commonly
used by graphical desktop environments to take over suspend
and hibernation handling, and to use their own configuration
mechanisms. If a low-level inhibitor lock is taken, logind
will not take any action when that key or switch is
triggered and the <i>Handle*=</i> settings are
irrelevant.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i>,
<i>SuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i>,
<i>HibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i>,
<i>LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=</i>,
<i>RebootKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Controls whether actions that
<b>systemd-logind</b> takes when the power, reboot and sleep
keys and the lid switch are triggered are subject to
high-level inhibitor locks (&quot;shutdown&quot;,
&quot;reboot&quot;, &quot;sleep&quot;, &quot;idle&quot;).
Low level inhibitor locks (&quot;handle-power-key&quot;,
&quot;handle-suspend-key&quot;,
&quot;handle-hibernate-key&quot;,
&quot;handle-lid-switch&quot;,
&quot;handle-reboot-key&quot;), are always honored,
irrespective of this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These settings
take boolean arguments. If &quot;no&quot;, the inhibitor
locks taken by applications are respected. If
&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;shutdown&quot;, &quot;reboot&quot;
&quot;sleep&quot;, and &quot;idle&quot; inhibitor locks are
ignored. <i>PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i>,
<i>SuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i>,
<i>HibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i> and
<i>RebootKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i> default to &quot;no&quot;.
<i>LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=</i> defaults to
&quot;yes&quot;. This means that when <b>systemd-logind</b>
is handling events by itself (no low level inhibitor locks
are taken by another application), the lid switch does not
respect suspend blockers by default, but the power and sleep
keys do.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>HoldoffTimeoutSec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies a period of time
after system startup or system resume in which systemd will
hold off on reacting to lid events. This is required for the
system to properly detect any hotplugged devices so systemd
can ignore lid events if external monitors, or docks, are
connected. If set to 0, systemd will always react
immediately, possibly before the kernel fully probed all
hotplugged devices. This is safe, as long as you do not care
for systemd to account for devices that have been plugged or
unplugged while the system was off. Defaults to 30s.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>RuntimeDirectorySize=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the size limit on the
<i>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</i> runtime directory for each user who
logs in. Takes a size in bytes, optionally suffixed with the
usual K, G, M, and T suffixes, to the base 1024 (IEC).
Alternatively, a numerical percentage suffixed by
&quot;%&quot; may be specified, which sets the size limit
relative to the amount of physical RAM. Defaults to 10%.
Note that this size is a safety limit only. As each runtime
directory is a tmpfs file system, it will only consume as
much memory as is needed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>RuntimeDirectoryInodesMax=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the limit on number of
inodes for the <i>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</i> runtime directory for
each user who logs in. Takes a number, optionally suffixed
with the usual K, G, M, and T suffixes, to the base 1024
(IEC). Defaults to <i>RuntimeDirectorySize=</i> divided by
4096. Note that this size is a safety limit only. As each
runtime directory is a tmpfs file system, it will only
consume as much memory as is needed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>InhibitorsMax=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Controls the maximum number of
concurrent inhibitors to permit. Defaults to 8192 (8K).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>SessionsMax=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Controls the maximum number of
concurrent user sessions to manage. Defaults to 8192 (8K).
Depending on how the pam_systemd.so module is included in
the PAM stack configuration, further login sessions will
either be refused, or permitted but not tracked by
systemd-logind.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>RemoveIPC=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Controls whether System V and
POSIX IPC objects belonging to the user shall be removed
when the user fully logs out. Takes a boolean argument. If
enabled, the user may not consume IPC resources after the
last of the user's sessions terminated. This covers System V
semaphores, shared memory and message queues, as well as
POSIX shared memory and message queues. Note that IPC
objects of the root user and other system users are excluded
from the effect of this setting. Defaults to
&quot;yes&quot;.</p>
