</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The timezone
information files used by <a href="https://man.page/3/tzset">tzset(3)</a> are typically
found under a directory with a name like
<i>/usr/share/zoneinfo</i>. These files use the format
described in Internet RFC 8536. Each file is a sequence of
8-bit bytes. In a file, a binary integer is represented by a
sequence of one or more bytes in network order (bigendian,
or high-order byte first), with all bits significant, a
signed binary integer is represented using two&rsquo;s
complement, and a boolean is represented by a one-byte
binary integer that is either 0 (false) or 1 (true). The
format begins with a 44-byte header containing the following
fields:</p>

realistic applications <i>tt_utoff</i> is in the range
[-89999, 93599] (i.e., more than -25 hours and less than 26

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
standard/wall and UT/local indicators were designed for
transforming a TZif file&rsquo;s transition times into
transitions appropriate for another time zone specified via
a POSIX-style TZ string that lacks rules. For example, when
TZ=&quot;EET-2EEST&quot; and there is no TZif file
&quot;EET-2EEST&quot;, the idea was to adapt the transition
times from a TZif file with the well-known name
&quot;posixrules&quot; that is present only for this purpose
and is a copy of the file &quot;Europe/Brussels&quot;, a
file with a different UT offset. POSIX does not specify this
obsolete transformational behavior, the default rules are
installation-dependent, and no implementation is known to
support this feature for timestamps past 2037, so users
desiring (say) Greek time should instead specify
TZ=&quot;Europe/Athens&quot; for better historical coverage,
falling back on TZ=&quot;EET-2EEST,M3.5.0/3,M10.5.0/4&quot;
if POSIX conformance is required and older timestamps need
not be handled accurately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<a href="https://man.page/3/localtime">localtime(3)</a> function normally uses the first
<i>ttinfo</i> structure in the file if either
<i>tzh_timecnt</i> is zero or the time argument is less than
the first transition time recorded in the file.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page documents <i>&lt;tzfile.h&gt;</i> in the glibc source
archive, see <i>timezone/tzfile.h</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It seems that
timezone uses <b>tzfile</b> internally, but glibc refuses to
expose it to userspace. This is most likely because the
standardised functions are more useful and portable, and
actually documented by glibc. It may only be in glibc just
to support the non-glibc-maintained timezone data (which is
maintained by some other entity).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Version 2
format</b> <br>
For version-2-format timezone files, the above header and
data are followed by a second header and data, identical in
format except that eight bytes are used for each transition
time or leap second time. (Leap second counts remain four
bytes.) After the second header and data comes a
newline-enclosed, POSIX-TZ-environment-variable-style string
for use in handling instants after the last transition time
stored in the file or for all instants if the file has no
transitions. The POSIX-style TZ string is empty (i.e.,
nothing between the newlines) if there is no POSIX
representation for such instants. If nonempty, the
POSIX-style TZ string must agree with the local time type
after the last transition time if present in the eight-byte
data; for example, given the string
&ldquo;WET0WEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3&rdquo; then if a last
transition time is in July, the transition&rsquo;s local
time type must specify a daylight-saving time abbreviated
&ldquo;WEST&rdquo; that is one hour east of UT. Also, if
there is at least one transition, time type 0 is associated
with the time period from the indefinite past up to but not
including the earliest transition time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Version 3
format</b> <br>
For version-3-format timezone files, the POSIX-TZ-style
string may use two minor extensions to the POSIX TZ format,
as described in <a href="https://man.page/3/newtzset">newtzset(3)</a>. First, the hours part of
its transition times may be signed and range from -167
through 167 instead of the POSIX-required unsigned values
from 0 through 24. Second, DST is in effect all year if it
starts January 1 at 00:00 and ends December 31 at 24:00 plus
the difference between daylight saving and standard
time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Interoperability
considerations</b> <br>
Future changes to the format may append more data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 1 files
are considered a legacy format and should be avoided, as
they do not support transition times after the year 2038.
Readers that only understand Version 1 must ignore any data
that extends beyond the calculated end of the version 1 data
block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Writers should
generate a version 3 file if TZ string extensions are
necessary to accurately model transition times. Otherwise,
version 2 files should be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sequence of
time changes defined by the version 1 header and data block
should be a contiguous subsequence of the time changes
defined by the version 2+ header and data block, and by the
footer. This guideline helps obsolescent version 1 readers
agree with current readers about timestamps within the
contiguous subsequence. It also lets writers not supporting
obsolescent readers use a <i>tzh_timecnt</i> of zero in the
version 1 data block to save space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Time zone
designations should consist of at least three (3) and no
more than six (6) ASCII characters from the set of
alphanumerics, &ldquo;-&rdquo;, and &ldquo;+&rdquo;. This is
for compatibility with POSIX requirements for time zone
abbreviations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When reading a
version 2 or 3 file, readers should ignore the version 1
header and data block except for the purpose of skipping
over them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Readers should
calculate the total lengths of the headers and data blocks
and check that they all fit within the actual file size, as
part of a validity check for the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Common
interoperability issues</b> <br>
This section documents common problems in reading or writing
TZif files. Most of these are problems in generating TZif
files for use by older readers. The goals of this section
are:</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When new
versions of the TZif format have been defined, a design goal
has been that a reader can successfully use a TZif file even
if the file is of a later TZif version than what the reader
was designed for. When complete compatibility was not
achieved, an attempt was made to limit glitches to rarely
used timestamps, and to allow simple partial workarounds in
writers designed to generate new-version data useful even
for older-version readers. This section attempts to document
these compatibility issues and workarounds, as well as to
document other common bugs in readers.</p>
