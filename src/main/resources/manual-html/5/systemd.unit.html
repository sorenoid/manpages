<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A unit file is
a plain text ini-style file that encodes information about a
service, a socket, a device, a mount point, an automount
point, a swap file or partition, a start-up target, a
watched file system path, a timer controlled and supervised
by <a href="https://man.page/1/systemd">systemd(1)</a>, a resource management slice or a group
of externally created processes. See
<b>systemd.syntax</b>(7) for a general description of the
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This man page
lists the common configuration options of all the unit
types. These options need to be configured in the [Unit] or
[Install] sections of the unit files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections described here,
each unit may have a type-specific section, e.g. [Service]
for a service unit. See the respective man pages for more
information: <b>systemd.service</b>(5),
<b>systemd.socket</b>(5), <b>systemd.device</b>(5),
<b>systemd.mount</b>(5), <b>systemd.automount</b>(5),
<b>systemd.swap</b>(5), <b>systemd.target</b>(5),
<b>systemd.path</b>(5), <b>systemd.timer</b>(5),
<b>systemd.slice</b>(5), <b>systemd.scope</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unit files are
loaded from a set of paths determined during compilation,
described in the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Valid unit
names consist of a &quot;name prefix&quot; and a dot and a
suffix specifying the unit type. The &quot;unit prefix&quot;
must consist of one or more valid characters (ASCII letters,
digits, &quot;:&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;_&quot;,
&quot;.&quot;, and &quot;\&quot;). The total length of the
unit name including the suffix must not exceed 256
characters. The type suffix must be one of
&quot;.service&quot;, &quot;.socket&quot;,
&quot;.device&quot;, &quot;.mount&quot;,
&quot;.automount&quot;, &quot;.swap&quot;,
&quot;.target&quot;, &quot;.path&quot;, &quot;.timer&quot;,
&quot;.slice&quot;, or &quot;.scope&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Units names can
be parameterized by a single argument called the
&quot;instance name&quot;. The unit is then constructed
based on a &quot;template file&quot; which serves as the
definition of multiple services or other units. A template
unit must have a single &quot;@&quot; at the end of the name
(right before the type suffix). The name of the full unit is
formed by inserting the instance name between &quot;@&quot;
and the unit type suffix. In the unit file itself, the
instance parameter may be referred to using &quot;%i&quot;
and other specifiers, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unit files may
contain additional options on top of those listed here. If
systemd encounters an unknown option, it will write a
warning log message but continue loading the unit. If an
option or section name is prefixed with <b>X-</b>, it is
ignored completely by systemd. Options within an ignored
section do not need the prefix. Applications may use this to
include additional information in the unit files. To access
those options, applications need to parse the unit files on
their own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Units can be
aliased (have an alternative name), by creating a symlink
from the new name to the existing name in one of the unit
search paths. For example, systemd-networkd.service has the
alias dbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service, created during
installation as a symlink, so when <b>systemd</b> is asked
through D-Bus to load dbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service,
it'll load systemd-networkd.service. As another example,
default.target &mdash; the default system target started at
boot &mdash; is commonly symlinked (aliased) to either
multi-user.target or graphical.target to select what is
started by default. Alias names may be used in commands like
<b>disable</b>, <b>start</b>, <b>stop</b>, <b>status</b>,
and similar, and in all unit dependency directives,
including <i>Wants=</i>, <i>Requires=</i>, <i>Before=</i>,
<i>After=</i>. Aliases cannot be used with the <b>preset</b>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Aliases obey
the following restrictions: a unit of a certain type
(&quot;.service&quot;, &quot;.socket&quot;, ...) can only be
aliased by a name with the same type suffix. A plain unit
(not a template or an instance), may only be aliased by a
plain name. A template instance may only be aliased by
another template instance, and the instance part must be
identical. A template may be aliased by another template (in
which case the alias applies to all instances of the
template). As a special case, a template instance (e.g.
&quot;alias@inst.service&quot;) may be a symlink to
different template (e.g. &quot;template@inst.service&quot;).
In that case, just this specific instance is aliased, while
other instances of the template (e.g.
&quot;alias@foo.service&quot;,
&quot;alias@bar.service&quot;) are not aliased. Those rule
preserve the requirement that the instance (if any) is
always uniquely defined for a given unit and all its
aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unit files may
specify aliases through the <i>Alias=</i> directive in the
[Install] section. When the unit is enabled, symlinks will
be created for those names, and removed when the unit is
disabled. For example, reboot.target specifies
<i>Alias=ctrl-alt-del.target</i>, so when enabled, the
symlink /etc/systemd/system/ctrl-alt-del.service pointing to
the reboot.target file will be created, and when
Ctrl+Alt+Del is invoked, <b>systemd</b> will look for the
ctrl-alt-del.service and execute reboot.service.
<b>systemd</b> does not look at the [Install] section at all
during normal operation, so any directives in that section
only have an effect through the symlinks created during
enablement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Along with a
unit file foo.service, the directory foo.service.wants/ may
exist. All unit files symlinked from such a directory are
implicitly added as dependencies of type <i>Wants=</i> to
the unit. Similar functionality exists for <i>Requires=</i>
type dependencies as well, the directory suffix is
.requires/ in this case. This functionality is useful to
hook units into the start-up of other units, without having
to modify their unit files. For details about the semantics
of <i>Wants=</i>, see below. The preferred way to create
symlinks in the .wants/ or .requires/ directory of a unit
file is by embedding the dependency in [Install] section of
the target unit, and creating the symlink in the file system
with the <b>enable</b> or <b>preset</b> commands of
<a href="https://man.page/1/systemctl">systemctl(1)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Along with a
unit file foo.service, a &quot;drop-in&quot; directory
foo.service.d/ may exist. All files with the suffix
&quot;.conf&quot; from this directory will be merged in the
alphanumeric order and parsed after the main unit file
itself has been parsed. This is useful to alter or add
configuration settings for a unit, without having to modify
unit files. Each drop-in file must contain appropriate
section headers. For instantiated units, this logic will
first look for the instance &quot;.d/&quot; subdirectory
(e.g. &quot;foo@bar.service.d/&quot;) and read its
&quot;.conf&quot; files, followed by the template
&quot;.d/&quot; subdirectory (e.g.
&quot;foo@.service.d/&quot;) and the &quot;.conf&quot; files
there. Moreover for unit names containing dashes
(&quot;-&quot;), the set of directories generated by
repeatedly truncating the unit name after all dashes is
searched too. Specifically, for a unit name
foo-bar-baz.service not only the regular drop-in directory
foo-bar-baz.service.d/ is searched but also both
foo-bar-.service.d/ and foo-.service.d/. This is useful for
defining common drop-ins for a set of related units, whose
names begin with a common prefix. This scheme is
particularly useful for mount, automount and slice units,
whose systematic naming structure is built around dashes as
component separators. Note that equally named drop-in files
further down the prefix hierarchy override those further up,
i.e. foo-bar-.service.d/10-override.conf overrides
foo-.service.d/10-override.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In cases of
unit aliases (described above), dropins for the aliased name
and all aliases are loaded. In the example of default.target
aliasing graphical.target, default.target.d/,
default.target.wants/, default.target.requires/,
graphical.target.d/, graphical.target.wants/,
graphical.target.requires/ would all be read. For templates,
dropins for the template, any template aliases, the template
instance, and all alias instances are read. When just a
specific template instance is aliased, then the dropins for
the target template, the target template instance, and the
alias template instance are read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
/etc/systemd/system, the drop-in &quot;.d/&quot; directories
for system services can be placed in /lib/systemd/system or
/run/systemd/system directories. Drop-in files in /etc/ take
precedence over those in /run/ which in turn take precedence
over those in /lib/. Drop-in files under any of these
directories take precedence over unit files wherever
located. Multiple drop-in files with different names are
applied in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the
directories they reside in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Units also
support a top-level drop-in with <i>type</i>.d/, where
<i>type</i> may be e.g. &quot;service&quot; or
&quot;socket&quot;, that allows altering or adding to the
settings of all corresponding unit files on the system. The
formatting and precedence of applying drop-in configurations
follow what is defined above. Files in <i>type</i>.d/ have
lower precedence compared to files in name-specific override
directories. The usual rules apply: multiple drop-in files
with different names are applied in lexicographic order,
regardless of which of the directories they reside in, so a
file in <i>type</i>.d/ applies to a unit only if there are
no drop-ins or masks with that name in directories with
higher precedence. See Examples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that while
systemd offers a flexible dependency system between units it
is recommended to use this functionality only sparingly and
instead rely on techniques such as bus-based or socket-based
activation which make dependencies implicit, resulting in a
both simpler and more flexible system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As mentioned
above, a unit may be instantiated from a template file. This
allows creation of multiple units from a single
configuration file. If systemd looks for a unit
configuration file, it will first search for the literal
unit name in the file system. If that yields no success and
the unit name contains an &quot;@&quot; character, systemd
will look for a unit template that shares the same name but
with the instance string (i.e. the part between the
&quot;@&quot; character and the suffix) removed. Example: if
a service getty@tty3.service is requested and no file by
that name is found, systemd will look for getty@.service and
instantiate a service from that configuration file if it is
found.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To refer to the
instance string from within the configuration file you may
use the special &quot;%i&quot; specifier in many of the
configuration options. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a unit file
is empty (i.e. has the file size 0) or is symlinked to
/dev/null, its configuration will not be loaded and it
appears with a load state of &quot;masked&quot;, and cannot
be activated. Use this as an effective way to fully disable
a unit, making it impossible to start it even manually.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The unit file
format is covered by the <b><font color="#0000FF">Interface

<h2>STRING ESCAPING FOR INCLUSION IN UNIT NAMES
<a name="STRING ESCAPING FOR INCLUSION IN UNIT NAMES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Sometimes
it is useful to convert arbitrary strings into unit names.
To facilitate this, a method of string escaping is used, in
order to map strings containing arbitrary byte values
(except <b>NUL</b>) into valid unit names and their
restricted character set. A common special case are unit
names that reflect paths to objects in the file system
hierarchy. Example: a device unit dev-sda.device refers to a
device with the device node /dev/sda in the file
system.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
escaping algorithm operates as follows: given a string, any
&quot;/&quot; character is replaced by &quot;-&quot;, and
all other characters which are not ASCII alphanumerics,
&quot;:&quot;, &quot;_&quot; or &quot;.&quot; are replaced
by C-style &quot;\x2d&quot; escapes. In addition,
&quot;.&quot; is replaced with such a C-style escape when it
would appear as the first character in the escaped
string.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
the input qualifies as absolute file system path, this
algorithm is extended slightly: the path to the root
directory &quot;/&quot; is encoded as single dash
&quot;-&quot;. In addition, any leading, trailing or
duplicate &quot;/&quot; characters are removed from the
string before transformation. Example: /foo//bar/baz/
becomes &quot;foo-bar-baz&quot;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
escaping is fully reversible, as long as it is known whether
the escaped string was a path (the unescaping results are
different for paths and non-path strings). The
<a href="https://man.page/1/systemd-escape">systemd-escape(1)</a> command may be used to apply and
reverse escaping on arbitrary strings. Use <b>systemd-escape
--path</b> to escape path strings, and <b>systemd-escape</b>
without <b>--path</b> otherwise.</font></p>

<h2>AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES
<a name="AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Implicit
Dependencies</b> <br>
A number of unit dependencies are implicitly established,
depending on unit type and unit configuration. These
implicit dependencies can make unit configuration file
cleaner. For the implicit dependencies in each unit type,
please refer to section &quot;Implicit Dependencies&quot; in
respective man pages.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">For
example, service units with <i>Type=dbus</i> automatically
acquire dependencies of type <i>Requires=</i> and
<i>After=</i> on dbus.socket. See <b>systemd.service</b>(5)
for details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Default
Dependencies</b> <br>
Default dependencies are similar to implicit dependencies,
but can be turned on and off by setting
<i>DefaultDependencies=</i> to <i>yes</i> (the default) and
<i>no</i>, while implicit dependencies are always in effect.
See section &quot;Default Dependencies&quot; in respective
man pages for the effect of enabling
<i>DefaultDependencies=</i> in each unit types.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">For
example, target units will complement all configured
dependencies of type <i>Wants=</i> or <i>Requires=</i> with
dependencies of type <i>After=</i> unless
<i>DefaultDependencies=no</i> is set in the specified units.
See <b>systemd.target</b>(5) for details. Note that this
behavior can be turned off by setting
<i>DefaultDependencies=no</i>.</font></p>

<h2>UNIT FILE LOAD PATH
<a name="UNIT FILE LOAD PATH"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Unit
files are loaded from a set of paths determined during
compilation, described in the two tables below. Unit files
found in directories listed earlier override files with the
same name in directories lower in the list.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
the variable <i>$SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH</i> is set, the contents
of this variable overrides the unit load path. If
<i>$SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH</i> ends with an empty component
(&quot;:&quot;), the usual unit load path will be appended
to the contents of the variable.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
set of load paths for the user manager instance may be
augmented or changed using various environment variables.
And environment variables may in turn be set using
environment generators, see
<b>systemd.environment-generator</b>(7). In particular,
<i>$XDG_DATA_HOME</i> and <i>$XDG_DATA_DIRS</i> may be
easily set using <b>systemd-environment-d-generator</b>(8).
Thus, directories listed here are just the defaults. To see
the actual list that would be used based on compilation

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Moreover,
additional units might be loaded into systemd from
directories not on the unit load path by creating a symlink
pointing to a unit file in the directories. You can use
<b>systemctl link</b> for this operation. See
<a href="https://man.page/1/systemctl">systemctl(1)</a> for its usage and precaution.</font></p>

<h2>UNIT GARBAGE COLLECTION
<a name="UNIT GARBAGE COLLECTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
system and service manager loads a unit's configuration
automatically when a unit is referenced for the first time.
It will automatically unload the unit configuration and
state again when the unit is not needed anymore
(&quot;garbage collection&quot;). A unit may be referenced
through a number of different mechanisms:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">1.
Another loaded unit references it with a dependency such as
<i>After=</i>, <i>Wants=</i>, ...</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">2.
The unit is currently starting, running, reloading or
stopping.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">3.
The unit is currently in the <b>failed</b> state. (But see
below.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">4.
A job for the unit is pending.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">5.
The unit is pinned by an active IPC client
program.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">6.
The unit is a special &quot;perpetual&quot; unit that is
always active and loaded. Examples for perpetual units are
the root mount unit -.mount or the scope unit init.scope
that the service manager itself lives in.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">7.
The unit has running processes associated with
it.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
garbage collection logic may be altered with the
<i>CollectMode=</i> option, which allows configuration
whether automatic unloading of units that are in
<b>failed</b> state is permissible, see below.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that when a unit's configuration and state is unloaded, all
execution results, such as exit codes, exit signals,
resource consumption and other statistics are lost, except
for what is stored in the log subsystem.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Use
<b>systemctl daemon-reload</b> or an equivalent command to
reload unit configuration while the unit is already loaded.
In this case all configuration settings are flushed out and
replaced with the new configuration (which however might not
be in effect immediately), however all runtime state is
saved/restored.</font></p>

<h2>[UNIT] SECTION OPTIONS
<a name="[UNIT] SECTION OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
unit file may include a [Unit] section, which carries
generic information about the unit that is not dependent on
the type of unit:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Description=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A short
human readable title of the unit. This may be used by
<b>systemd</b> (and other UIs) as a user-visible label for
the unit, so this string should identify the unit rather
than describe it, despite the name. This string also
shouldn't just repeat the unit name. &quot;Apache2 Web
Server&quot; is a good example. Bad examples are
&quot;high-performance light-weight HTTP server&quot; (too
generic) or &quot;Apache2&quot; (meaningless for people who
do not know Apache, duplicates the unit name).
<b>systemd</b> may use this string as a noun in status
messages (&quot;Starting <i>description</i>...&quot;,
&quot;Started <i>description</i>.&quot;, &quot;Reached
target <i>description</i>.&quot;, &quot;Failed to start

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Wants=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
(weak) requirement dependencies on other units. This option
may be specified more than once or multiple space-separated
units may be specified in one option in which case
dependencies for all listed names will be created.
Dependencies of this type may also be configured outside of
the unit configuration file by adding a symlink to a .wants/
directory accompanying the unit file. For details, see
above.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Units
listed in this option will be started if the configuring
unit is. However, if the listed units fail to start or
cannot be added to the transaction, this has no impact on
the validity of the transaction as a whole, and this unit
will still be started. This is the recommended way to hook
the start-up of one unit to the start-up of another
unit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that requirement dependencies do not influence the order in
which services are started or stopped. This has to be
configured independently with the <i>After=</i> or
<i>Before=</i> options. If unit foo.service pulls in unit
bar.service as configured with <i>Wants=</i> and no ordering
is configured with <i>After=</i> or <i>Before=</i>, then
both units will be started simultaneously and without any
delay between them if foo.service is activated.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Requires=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Similar
to <i>Wants=</i>, but declares a stronger requirement
dependency. Dependencies of this type may also be configured
by adding a symlink to a .requires/ directory accompanying
the unit file.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
this unit gets activated, the units listed will be activated
as well. If one of the other units fails to activate, and an
ordering dependency <i>After=</i> on the failing unit is
set, this unit will not be started. Besides, with or without
specifying <i>After=</i>, this unit will be stopped if one
of the other units is explicitly stopped.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Often,
it is a better choice to use <i>Wants=</i> instead of
<i>Requires=</i> in order to achieve a system that is more
robust when dealing with failing services.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that this dependency type does not imply that the other unit
always has to be in active state when this unit is running.
Specifically: failing condition checks (such as
<i>ConditionPathExists=</i>,
<i>ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=</i>, ... &mdash; see below)
do not cause the start job of a unit with a <i>Requires=</i>
dependency on it to fail. Also, some unit types may
deactivate on their own (for example, a service process may
decide to exit cleanly, or a device may be unplugged by the
user), which is not propagated to units having a
<i>Requires=</i> dependency. Use the <i>BindsTo=</i>
dependency type together with <i>After=</i> to ensure that a
unit may never be in active state without a specific other
unit also in active state (see below).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Requisite=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Similar
to <i>Requires=</i>. However, if the units listed here are
not started already, they will not be started and the
starting of this unit will fail immediately.
<i>Requisite=</i> does not imply an ordering dependency,
even if both units are started in the same transaction.
Hence this setting should usually be combined with
<i>After=</i>, to ensure this unit is not started before the
other unit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
<i>Requisite=b.service</i> is used on a.service, this
dependency will show as <i>RequisiteOf=a.service</i> in
property listing of b.service. <i>RequisiteOf=</i>
dependency cannot be specified directly.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>BindsTo=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
requirement dependencies, very similar in style to
<i>Requires=</i>. However, this dependency type is stronger:
in addition to the effect of <i>Requires=</i> it declares
that if the unit bound to is stopped, this unit will be
stopped too. This means a unit bound to another unit that
suddenly enters inactive state will be stopped too. Units
can suddenly, unexpectedly enter inactive state for
different reasons: the main process of a service unit might
terminate on its own choice, the backing device of a device
unit might be unplugged or the mount point of a mount unit
might be unmounted without involvement of the system and
service manager.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
used in conjunction with <i>After=</i> on the same unit the
behaviour of <i>BindsTo=</i> is even stronger. In this case,
the unit bound to strictly has to be in active state for
this unit to also be in active state. This not only means a
unit bound to another unit that suddenly enters inactive
state, but also one that is bound to another unit that gets
skipped due to a failed condition check (such as
<i>ConditionPathExists=</i>,
<i>ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=</i>, ... &mdash; see below)
will be stopped, should it be running. Hence, in many cases
it is best to combine <i>BindsTo=</i> with
<i>After=</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
<i>BindsTo=b.service</i> is used on a.service, this
dependency will show as <i>BoundBy=a.service</i> in property

specified directly.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>PartOf=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
dependencies similar to <i>Requires=</i>, but limited to
stopping and restarting of units. When systemd stops or
restarts the units listed here, the action is propagated to
this unit. Note that this is a one-way
dependency&nbsp;&mdash; changes to this unit do not affect
the listed units.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Upholds=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
dependencies similar to <i>Wants=</i>, but as long a this
unit is up, all units listed in <i>Upholds=</i> are started
whenever found to be inactive or failed, and no job is
queued for them. While a <i>Wants=</i> dependency on another
unit has a one-time effect when this units started, a
<i>Upholds=</i> dependency on it has a continuous effect,
constantly restarting the unit if necessary. This is an
alternative to the <i>Restart=</i> setting of service units,
to ensure they are kept running whatever happens.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
<i>Upholds=b.service</i> is used on a.service, this
dependency will show as <i>UpheldBy=a.service</i> in the

dependency cannot be specified directly.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Conflicts=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A
space-separated list of unit names. Configures negative
requirement dependencies. If a unit has a <i>Conflicts=</i>
setting on another unit, starting the former will stop the
latter and vice versa.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that this setting does not imply an ordering dependency,
similarly to the <i>Wants=</i> and <i>Requires=</i>
dependencies described above. This means that to ensure that
the conflicting unit is stopped before the other unit is
started, an <i>After=</i> or <i>Before=</i> dependency must
be declared. It doesn't matter which of the two ordering
dependencies is used, because stop jobs are always ordered
before start jobs, see the discussion in
<i>Before=</i>/<i>After=</i> below.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
unit A that conflicts with unit B is scheduled to be started
at the same time as B, the transaction will either fail (in
case both are required parts of the transaction) or be
modified to be fixed (in case one or both jobs are not a
required part of the transaction). In the latter case, the
job that is not required will be removed, or in case both
are not required, the unit that conflicts will be started
and the unit that is conflicted is stopped.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Before=</i>,
<i>After=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">These two
settings expect a space-separated list of unit names. They
may be specified more than once, in which case dependencies
for all listed names are created.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Those
two settings configure ordering dependencies between units.
If unit foo.service contains the setting
<b>Before=bar.service</b> and both units are being started,
bar.service's start-up is delayed until foo.service has
finished starting up. <i>After=</i> is the inverse of
<i>Before=</i>, i.e. while <i>Before=</i> ensures that the
configured unit is started before the listed unit begins
starting up, <i>After=</i> ensures the opposite, that the
listed unit is fully started up before the configured unit
is started.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
two units with an ordering dependency between them are shut
down, the inverse of the start-up order is applied. I.e. if
a unit is configured with <i>After=</i> on another unit, the
former is stopped before the latter if both are shut down.
Given two units with any ordering dependency between them,
if one unit is shut down and the other is started up, the
shutdown is ordered before the start-up. It doesn't matter
if the ordering dependency is <i>After=</i> or
<i>Before=</i>, in this case. It also doesn't matter which
of the two is shut down, as long as one is shut down and the
other is started up; the shutdown is ordered before the
start-up in all cases. If two units have no ordering
dependencies between them, they are shut down or started up
simultaneously, and no ordering takes place. It depends on
the unit type when precisely a unit has finished starting
up. Most importantly, for service units start-up is
considered completed for the purpose of
<i>Before=</i>/<i>After=</i> when all its configured
start-up commands have been invoked and they either failed
or reported start-up success. Note that this does includes
<i>ExecStartPost=</i> (or <i>ExecStopPost=</i> for the
shutdown case).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that those settings are independent of and orthogonal to the
requirement dependencies as configured by <i>Requires=</i>,
<i>Wants=</i>, <i>Requisite=</i>, or <i>BindsTo=</i>. It is
a common pattern to include a unit name in both the
<i>After=</i> and <i>Wants=</i> options, in which case the
unit listed will be started before the unit that is
configured with these options.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that <i>Before=</i> dependencies on device units have no
effect and are not supported. Devices generally become
available as a result of an external hotplug event, and
systemd creates the corresponding device unit without
delay.</font></p>

listed unit that is started. If multiple listed units are
already started, it is not defined which namespace is
joined. Note that this setting only has an effect if

activated or deactivated indirectly. In this case, explicit
start-up or termination requested by the user is denied,
however if it is started or stopped as a dependency of

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. If <b>yes</b>, (the default), a few
default dependencies will implicitly be created for the
unit. The actual dependencies created depend on the unit
type. For example, for service units, these dependencies
ensure that the service is started only after basic system
initialization is completed and is properly terminated on
system shutdown. See the respective man pages for details.
Generally, only services involved with early boot or late
shutdown should set this option to <b>no</b>. It is highly
recommended to leave this option enabled for the majority of

even if the unit is in a <b>failed</b> state, and thus an
explicitly resetting of the <b>failed</b> state is not
necessary. Note that if this mode is used unit results (such

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If

result in data loss (i.e. equivalent to <b>systemctl reboot

<b>poweroff-immediate</b> have the effect of powering down
the system with similar semantics. <b>exit</b> causes the
manager to exit following the normal shutdown procedure, and

restart logic is activated again. <b>systemctl
reset-failed</b> will cause the restart rate counter for a
service to be flushed, which is useful if the administrator
wants to manually start a unit and the start limit
interferes with that. Rate-limiting is enforced after any
unit condition checks are executed, and hence unit
activations with failing conditions do not count towards the
rate limit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
a unit is unloaded due to the garbage collection logic (see
above) its rate limit counters are flushed out too. This
means that configuring start rate limiting for a unit that
is not referenced continuously has no effect.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
setting does not apply to slice, target, device, and scope

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>SourcePath=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A path to
a configuration file this unit has been generated from. This
is primarily useful for implementation of generator tools
that convert configuration from an external configuration
file format into native unit files. This functionality
should not be used in normal units.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Conditions
and Asserts</b> <br>
Unit files may also include a number of <i>Condition...=</i>
and <i>Assert...=</i> settings. Before the unit is started,
systemd will verify that the specified conditions and
asserts are true. If not, the starting of the unit will be
(mostly silently) skipped (in case of conditions), or
aborted with an error message (in case of asserts). Failing
conditions or asserts will not result in the unit being
moved into the &quot;failed&quot; state. The conditions and
asserts are checked at the time the queued start job is to
be executed. The ordering dependencies are still respected,
so other units are still pulled in and ordered as if this
unit was successfully activated, and the conditions and
asserts are executed the precise moment the unit would
normally start and thus can validate system state after the
units ordered before completed initialization. Use condition
expressions for skipping units that do not apply to the
local system, for example because the kernel or runtime
environment doesn't require their functionality.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
multiple conditions are specified, the unit will be executed
if all of them apply (i.e. a logical AND is applied).
Condition checks can use a pipe symbol (&quot;|&quot;) after
the equals sign (&quot;Condition...=|...&quot;), which
causes the condition to become a <i>triggering</i>
condition. If at least one triggering condition is defined
for a unit, then the unit will be started if at least one of
the triggering conditions of the unit applies and all of the
regular (i.e. non-triggering) conditions apply. If you
prefix an argument with the pipe symbol and an exclamation
mark, the pipe symbol must be passed first, the exclamation
second. If any of these options is assigned the empty
string, the list of conditions is reset completely, all
previous condition settings (of any kind) will have no
effect.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<i>AssertArchitecture=</i>, <i>AssertVirtualization=</i>,
... options are similar to conditions but cause the start
job to fail (instead of being skipped). The failed check is
logged. Units with failed conditions are considered to be in
a clean state and will be garbage collected if they are not
referenced. This means that when queried, the condition
failure may or may not show up in the state of the
unit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that neither assertion nor condition expressions result in
unit state changes. Also note that both are checked at the
time the job is to be executed, i.e. long after depending
jobs and it itself were queued. Thus, neither condition nor
assertion expressions are suitable for conditionalizing unit
dependencies.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000"><i>ConditionKernelCommandLine=</i>
may be used to check whether a specific kernel command line
option is set (or if prefixed with the exclamation mark
&mdash; unset). The argument must either be a single word,
or an assignment (i.e. two words, separated by
&quot;=&quot;). In the former case the kernel command line
is searched for the word appearing as is, or as left hand
side of an assignment. In the latter case, the exact
assignment is looked for with right and left hand side
matching. This operates on the kernel command line
communicated to userspace via /proc/cmdline, except when the
service manager is invoked as payload of a container
manager, in which case the command line of PID 1 is used
instead (i.e. /proc/1/cmdline).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ConditionKernelVersion=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000"><i>ConditionKernelVersion=</i>
may be used to check whether the kernel version (as reported
by <b>uname -r</b>) matches a certain expression (or if
prefixed with the exclamation mark does not match it). The
argument must be a list of (potentially quoted) expressions.
For each of the expressions, if it starts with one of
&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&quot;, &quot;=&quot;,
&quot;!=&quot;, &quot;&gt;=&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot; a
relative version comparison is done, otherwise the specified

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that using the kernel version string is an unreliable way to
determine which features are supported by a kernel, because
of the widespread practice of backporting drivers, features,
and fixes from newer upstream kernels into older versions
provided by distributions. Hence, this check is inherently
unportable and should not be used for units which may be
used on different distributions.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000"><i>ConditionEnvironment=</i>
may be used to check whether a specific environment variable
is set (or if prefixed with the exclamation mark &mdash;
unset) in the service manager's environment block. The
argument may be a single word, to check if the variable with
this name is defined in the environment block, or an
assignment (&quot;<i>name</i>=<i>value</i>&quot;), to check
if the variable with this exact value is defined. Note that
the environment block of the service manager itself is
checked, i.e. not any variables defined with
<i>Environment=</i> or <i>EnvironmentFile=</i>, as described
above. This is particularly useful when the service manager
runs inside a containerized environment or as per-user
service manager, in order to check for variables passed in
by the enclosing container manager or PAM.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Check

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Check
whether the system has AC power, or is exclusively battery
powered at the time of activation of the unit. This takes a
boolean argument. If set to &quot;true&quot;, the condition

connected to a power source, or if no AC connectors are
known. Conversely, if set to &quot;false&quot;, the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ConditionNeedsUpdate=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes one
of /var/ or /etc/ as argument, possibly prefixed with a
&quot;!&quot; (to invert the condition). This condition may
be used to conditionalize units on whether the specified
directory requires an update because /usr/'s modification
time is newer than the stamp file .updated in the specified
directory. This is useful to implement offline updates of
the vendor operating system resources in /usr/ that require
updating of /etc/ or /var/ on the next following boot. Units
making use of this condition should order themselves before
<b>systemd-update-done.service</b>(8), to make sure they run
before the stamp file's modification time gets reset
indicating a completed update.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
the <i>systemd.condition-needs-update=</i> option is
specified on the kernel command line (taking a boolean), it
will override the result of this condition check, taking
precedence over any file modification time checks. If the
kernel command line option is used,
systemd-update-done.service will not have immediate effect
on any following <i>ConditionNeedsUpdate=</i> checks, until
the system is rebooted where the kernel command line option
is not specified anymore.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that to make this scheme effective, the timestamp of /usr/
should be explicitly updated after its contents are
modified. The kernel will automatically update modification
timestamp on a directory only when immediate children of a
directory are modified; an modification of nested files will
not automatically result in mtime of /usr/ being
updated.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Also
note that if the update method includes a call to execute
appropriate post-update steps itself, it should not touch
the timestamp of /usr/. In a typical distribution packaging
scheme, packages will do any required update steps as part
of the installation or upgrade, to make package contents
immediately usable. <i>ConditionNeedsUpdate=</i> should be
used with other update mechanisms where such an immediate
update does not happen.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ConditionFirstBoot=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. This condition may be used to
conditionalize units on whether the system is booting up for
the first time. This roughly means that /etc/ is unpopulated
(for details, see &quot;First Boot Semantics&quot; in
<a href="https://man.page/5/machine-id">machine-id(5)</a>). This may be used to populate /etc/ on
the first boot after factory reset, or when a new system
instance boots up for the first time.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">For
robustness, units with <i>ConditionFirstBoot=yes</i> should
order themselves before first-boot-complete.target and pull
in this passive target with <i>Wants=</i>. This ensures that
in a case of an aborted first boot, these units will be
re-run during the next system startup.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
the <i>systemd.condition-first-boot=</i> option is specified

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Check for

is similar to <i>ConditionPathExists=</i> but verifies that
the underlying file system's backing block device is

cover ext4 per-directory encryption, and only detects block
level encryption. Moreover, if the specified path resides on
a file system on top of a loopback block device, only
encryption above the loopback device is detected. It is not
detected whether the file system backing the loopback block
device is encrypted.</font></p>

loudly). Note that hitting a configured assertion does not
cause the unit to enter the &quot;failed&quot; state (or in
fact result in any state change of the unit), it affects
only the job queued for it. Use assertion expressions for
units that cannot operate when specific requirements are not
met, and when this is something the administrator or user
should look into.</font></p>

By default a unit with the same name is triggered, but this

<h2>[INSTALL] SECTION OPTIONS
<a name="[INSTALL] SECTION OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Unit
files may include an [Install] section, which carries
installation information for the unit. This section is not
interpreted by <a href="https://man.page/1/systemd">systemd(1)</a> during runtime; it is used
by the <b>enable</b> and <b>disable</b> commands of the
<a href="https://man.page/1/systemctl">systemctl(1)</a> tool during installation of a
unit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Alias=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A
space-separated list of additional names this unit shall be
installed under. The names listed here must have the same
suffix (i.e. type) as the unit filename. This option may be
specified more than once, in which case all listed names are
used. At installation time, <b>systemctl enable</b> will
create symlinks from these names to the unit filename. Note
that not all unit types support such alias names, and this
setting is not supported for them. Specifically, mount,
slice, swap, and automount units do not support
aliasing.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>WantedBy=</i>,
<i>RequiredBy=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option may be used more than once, or a space-separated list
of unit names may be given. A symbolic link is created in
the .wants/ or .requires/ directory of each of the listed
units when this unit is installed by <b>systemctl
enable</b>. This has the effect that a dependency of type
<i>Wants=</i> or <i>Requires=</i> is added from the listed
unit to the current unit. The primary result is that the
current unit will be started when the listed unit is
started. See the description of <i>Wants=</i> and
<i>Requires=</i> in the [Unit] section for
details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>WantedBy=foo.service</b>
in a service bar.service is mostly equivalent to
<b>Alias=foo.service.wants/bar.service</b> in the same file.
In case of template units, <b>systemctl enable</b> must be
called with an instance name, and this instance will be
added to the .wants/ or .requires/ list of the listed unit.
E.g. <b>WantedBy=getty.target</b> in a service
getty@.service will result in <b>systemctl enable
getty@tty2.service</b> creating a
getty.target.wants/getty@tty2.service link to
getty@.service.</font></p>

units to install/deinstall when this unit is
installed/deinstalled. If the user requests
installation/deinstallation of a unit with this option

listed in this option as well.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This

units to be enabled</b></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
following snippet (highlighted) allows a unit (e.g.
foo.service) to be enabled via <b>systemctl
enable</b>:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Unit]
<br>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Service]

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>[Install]
<br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">After
running <b>systemctl enable</b>, a symlink
/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/foo.service
linking to the actual unit will be created. It tells systemd
to pull in the unit when starting multi-user.target. The
inverse <b>systemctl disable</b> will remove that symlink
again.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Overriding
vendor settings</b></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">There
are two methods of overriding vendor settings in unit files:
copying the unit file from /lib/systemd/system to
/etc/systemd/system and modifying the chosen settings.
Alternatively, one can create a directory named
<i>unit</i>.d/ within /etc/systemd/system and place a
drop-in file <i>name</i>.conf there that only changes the
specific settings one is interested in. Note that multiple
such drop-in files are read if present, processed in
lexicographic order of their filename.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
advantage of the first method is that one easily overrides
the complete unit, the vendor unit is not parsed at all
anymore. It has the disadvantage that improvements to the
unit file by the vendor are not automatically incorporated
on updates.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
advantage of the second method is that one only overrides
the settings one specifically wants, where updates to the
unit by the vendor automatically apply. This has the
disadvantage that some future updates by the vendor might be
incompatible with the local changes.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
also applies for user instances of systemd, but with
different locations for the unit files. See the section on
unit load paths for further details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Suppose
there is a vendor-supplied unit
/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service with the following
contents:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Unit]
<br>
Description=Some HTTP server <br>
After=remote-fs.target sqldb.service <br>
Requires=sqldb.service <br>
AssertPathExists=/srv/webserver</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Service]
<br>
Type=notify <br>
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/some-fancy-httpd-server <br>
Nice=5</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Install]
<br>
WantedBy=multi-user.target</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Now
one wants to change some settings as an administrator:
firstly, in the local setup, /srv/webserver might not exist,
because the HTTP server is configured to use /srv/www
instead. Secondly, the local configuration makes the HTTP
server also depend on a memory cache service,
memcached.service, that should be pulled in
(<i>Requires=</i>) and also be ordered appropriately
(<i>After=</i>). Thirdly, in order to harden the service a
bit more, the administrator would like to set the
<i>PrivateTmp=</i> setting (see <b>systemd.exec</b>(5) for
details). And lastly, the administrator would like to reset
the niceness of the service to its default value of
0.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
first possibility is to copy the unit file to
/etc/systemd/system/httpd.service and change the chosen
settings:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Unit]
<br>
Description=Some HTTP server <br>
After=remote-fs.target sqldb.service
<i>memcached.service</i> <br>
Requires=sqldb.service <i>memcached.service</i> <br>
AssertPathExists=<i>/srv/www</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Service]
<br>
Type=notify <br>
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/some-fancy-httpd-server <i><br>
Nice=0 <br>
PrivateTmp=yes</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Install]
<br>
WantedBy=multi-user.target</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Alternatively,
the administrator could create a drop-in file
/etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/local.conf with the
following contents:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Unit]
<br>
After=memcached.service <br>
Requires=memcached.service <br>
# Reset all assertions and then re-add the condition we want
<br>
AssertPathExists= <br>
AssertPathExists=/srv/www</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Service]
<br>
Nice=0 <br>
PrivateTmp=yes</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that for drop-in files, if one wants to remove entries from
a setting that is parsed as a list (and is not a
dependency), such as <i>AssertPathExists=</i> (or e.g.
<i>ExecStart=</i> in service units), one needs to first
clear the list before re-adding all entries except the one
that is to be removed. Dependencies (<i>After=</i>, etc.)
cannot be reset to an empty list, so dependencies can only
be added in drop-ins. If you want to remove dependencies,
you have to override the entire unit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Top
level drop-ins with template units</b></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Top
level per-type drop-ins can be used to change some aspect of
all units of a particular type. For example by creating the
/etc/systemd/system/service.d/ directory with a drop-in
file, the contents of the drop-in file can be applied to all
service units. We can take this further by having the
top-level drop-in instantiate a secondary helper unit.
Consider for example the following set of units and drop-in
files where we install an <i>OnFailure=</i> dependency for
all service units.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">/etc/systemd/system/failure-handler@.service:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Unit]
<br>
Description=My failure handler for %i</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Service]
<br>
Type=oneshot <br>
# Perform some special action for when %i exits
unexpectedly. <br>
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/myfailurehandler %i</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">We
can then add an instance of failure-handler@.service as an
<i>OnFailure=</i> dependency for all service
units.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">/etc/systemd/system/service.d/10-all.conf:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">[Unit]
<br>
OnFailure=failure-handler@%N.service</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Now,
after running <b>systemctl daemon-reload</b> all services
will have acquired an <i>OnFailure=</i> dependency on
failure-handler@%N.service. The template instance units will
also have gained the dependency which results in the
creation of a recursive dependency chain. We can break the
chain by disabling the drop-in for the template instance
units via a symlink to /dev/null:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>mkdir
/etc/systemd/system/failure-handler@.service.d/ <br>
ln -s /dev/null
/etc/systemd/system/failure-handler@.service.d/10-all.conf
<br>
systemctl daemon-reload</b></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
ensures that if a failure-handler@.service instance fails it
will not trigger an instance named
failure-handler@failure-handler.service.</font></p>
