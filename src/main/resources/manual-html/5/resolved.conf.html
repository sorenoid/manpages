<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
configuration files control local DNS and LLMNR name
resolution.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
<a name="CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is
only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those
defaults. Initially, the main configuration file in
/etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the
defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides
can be created by editing this file or by creating drop-ins,
as described below. Using drop-ins for local configuration
is recommended over modifications to the main configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the &quot;main&quot; configuration file, drop-in
configuration snippets are read from
/usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and
/etc/systemd/*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins have higher
precedence and override the main configuration file. Files
in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by
their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in
which of the subdirectories they reside. When multiple files
specify the same option, for options which accept just a
single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes
precedence, and for options which accept a list of values,
entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When packages
need to customize the configuration, they can install
drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins
have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended
to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a
two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To disable a
configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended
way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration
directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor
configuration file.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are available in the [Resolve] section:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>DNS=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A space-separated list of IPv4
and IPv6 addresses to use as system DNS servers. Each
address can optionally take a port number separated with
&quot;:&quot;, a network interface name or index separated
with &quot;%&quot;, and a Server Name Indication (SNI)
separated with &quot;#&quot;. When IPv6 address is specified
with a port number, then the address must be in the square
brackets. That is, the acceptable full formats are
&quot;111.222.333.444:9953%ifname#example.com&quot; for IPv4
and &quot;[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example.com&quot;
for IPv6. DNS requests are sent to one of the listed DNS
servers in parallel to suitable per-link DNS servers
acquired from <b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) or set at
runtime by external applications. For compatibility reasons,
if this setting is not specified, the DNS servers listed in
/etc/resolv.conf are used instead, if that file exists and
any servers are configured in it. This setting defaults to
the empty list.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>FallbackDNS=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A space-separated list of IPv4
and IPv6 addresses to use as the fallback DNS servers.
Please see <i>DNS=</i> for acceptable format of addresses.
Any per-link DNS servers obtained from
<b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) take precedence over this
setting, as do any servers set via <i>DNS=</i> above or
/etc/resolv.conf. This setting is hence only used if no
other DNS server information is known. If this option is not
given, a compiled-in list of DNS servers is used
instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Domains=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A space-separated list of
domains optionally prefixed with &quot;~&quot;, used for two
distinct purposes described below. Defaults to the empty
list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any domains
<i>not</i> prefixed with &quot;~&quot; are used as search
suffixes when resolving single-label hostnames (domain names
which contain no dot), in order to qualify them into
fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs). These &quot;search
domains&quot; are strictly processed in the order they are
specified in, until the name with the suffix appended is
found. For compatibility reasons, if this setting is not
specified, the search domains listed in /etc/resolv.conf
with the <i>search</i> keyword are used instead, if that
file exists and any domains are configured in it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The domains
prefixed with &quot;~&quot; are called &quot;routing
domains&quot;. All domains listed here (both search domains
and routing domains after removing the &quot;~&quot; prefix)
define a search path that preferably directs DNS queries to
this interface. This search path has an effect only when
suitable per-link DNS servers are known. Such servers may be
defined through the <i>DNS=</i> setting (see above) and
dynamically at run time, for example from DHCP leases. If no
per-link DNS servers are known, routing domains have no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use the
construct &quot;~.&quot; (which is composed from
&quot;~&quot; to indicate a routing domain and &quot;.&quot;
to indicate the DNS root domain that is the implied suffix
of all DNS domains) to use the DNS servers defined for this
link preferably for all domains.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>LLMNR=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument or
&quot;resolve&quot;. Controls Link-Local Multicast Name
Resolution support (<b><font color="#0000FF">RFC
4795</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">) on the local host. If true, enables
full LLMNR responder and resolver support. If false,
disables both. If set to &quot;resolve&quot;, only
resolution support is enabled, but responding is disabled.
Note that <b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) also maintains
per-link LLMNR settings. LLMNR will be enabled on a link
only if the per-link and the global setting is
on.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>MulticastDNS=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or &quot;resolve&quot;. Controls Multicast
DNS support (</font><b><font color="#0000FF">RFC
6762</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[2]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">) on the local host. If true, enables
full Multicast DNS responder and resolver support. If false,
disables both. If set to &quot;resolve&quot;, only
resolution support is enabled, but responding is disabled.
Note that <b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) also maintains
per-link Multicast DNS settings. Multicast DNS will be
enabled on a link only if the per-link and the global
setting is on.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>DNSSEC=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or &quot;allow-downgrade&quot;. If true all
DNS lookups are DNSSEC-validated locally (excluding LLMNR
and Multicast DNS). If the response to a lookup request is
detected to be invalid a lookup failure is returned to
applications. Note that this mode requires a DNS server that
supports DNSSEC. If the DNS server does not properly support
DNSSEC all validations will fail. If set to
&quot;allow-downgrade&quot; DNSSEC validation is attempted,
but if the server does not support DNSSEC properly, DNSSEC
mode is automatically disabled. Note that this mode makes
DNSSEC validation vulnerable to &quot;downgrade&quot;
attacks, where an attacker might be able to trigger a
downgrade to non-DNSSEC mode by synthesizing a DNS response
that suggests DNSSEC was not supported. If set to false, DNS
lookups are not DNSSEC validated.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that DNSSEC validation requires retrieval of additional DNS
data, and thus results in a small DNS look-up time
penalty.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">DNSSEC
requires knowledge of &quot;trust anchors&quot; to prove
data integrity. The trust anchor for the Internet root
domain is built into the resolver, additional trust anchors
may be defined with <b>dnssec-trust-anchors.d</b>(5). Trust
anchors may change at regular intervals, and old trust
anchors may be revoked. In such a case DNSSEC validation is
not possible until new trust anchors are configured locally
or the resolver software package is updated with the new
root trust anchor. In effect, when the built-in trust anchor
is revoked and <i>DNSSEC=</i> is true, all further lookups
will fail, as it cannot be proved anymore whether lookups
are correctly signed, or validly unsigned. If <i>DNSSEC=</i>
is set to &quot;allow-downgrade&quot; the resolver will
automatically turn off DNSSEC validation in such a
case.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Client
programs looking up DNS data will be informed whether
lookups could be verified using DNSSEC, or whether the
returned data could not be verified (either because the data
was found unsigned in the DNS, or the DNS server did not
support DNSSEC or no appropriate trust anchors were known).
In the latter case it is assumed that client programs employ
a secondary scheme to validate the returned DNS data, should
this be required.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">It
is recommended to set <i>DNSSEC=</i> to true on systems
where it is known that the DNS server supports DNSSEC
correctly, and where software or trust anchor updates happen
regularly. On other systems it is recommended to set
<i>DNSSEC=</i> to &quot;allow-downgrade&quot;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
addition to this global DNSSEC setting
<b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) also maintains per-link
DNSSEC settings. For system DNS servers (see above), only
the global DNSSEC setting is in effect. For per-link DNS
servers the per-link setting is in effect, unless it is
unset in which case the global setting is used
instead.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Site-private
DNS zones generally conflict with DNSSEC operation, unless a
negative (if the private zone is not signed) or positive (if
the private zone is signed) trust anchor is configured for
them. If &quot;allow-downgrade&quot; mode is selected, it is
attempted to detect site-private DNS zones using top-level
domains (TLDs) that are not known by the DNS root server.
This logic does not work in all private zone
setups.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Defaults
to &quot;no&quot;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>DNSOverTLS=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or &quot;opportunistic&quot;. If true all
connections to the server will be encrypted. Note that this
mode requires a DNS server that supports DNS-over-TLS and
has a valid certificate. If the hostname was specified in
<i>DNS=</i> by using the format format
&quot;address#server_name&quot; it is used to validate its
certificate and also to enable Server Name Indication (SNI)
when opening a TLS connection. Otherwise the certificate is
checked against the server's IP. If the DNS server does not
support DNS-over-TLS all DNS requests will fail.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
set to &quot;opportunistic&quot; DNS request are attempted
to send encrypted with DNS-over-TLS. If the DNS server does
not support TLS, DNS-over-TLS is disabled. Note that this
mode makes DNS-over-TLS vulnerable to &quot;downgrade&quot;
attacks, where an attacker might be able to trigger a
downgrade to non-encrypted mode by synthesizing a response
that suggests DNS-over-TLS was not supported. If set to
false, DNS lookups are send over UDP.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that DNS-over-TLS requires additional data to be send for
setting up an encrypted connection, and thus results in a
small DNS look-up time penalty.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that in &quot;opportunistic&quot; mode the resolver is not
capable of authenticating the server, so it is vulnerable to
&quot;man-in-the-middle&quot; attacks.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
addition to this global <i>DNSOverTLS=</i> setting
<b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) also maintains per-link
<i>DNSOverTLS=</i> settings. For system DNS servers (see
above), only the global <i>DNSOverTLS=</i> setting is in
effect. For per-link DNS servers the per-link setting is in
effect, unless it is unset in which case the global setting
is used instead.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Defaults
to &quot;no&quot;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Cache=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean or &quot;no-negative&quot; as argument. If
&quot;yes&quot;, resolving a domain name which already got
queried earlier will return the previous result as long as
it is still valid, and thus does not result in a new network
request. Be aware that turning off caching comes at a
performance penalty, which is particularly high when DNSSEC
is used. If &quot;no-negative&quot; (the default), only
positive answers are cached.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that caching is turned off by default for host-local DNS
servers. See <i>CacheFromLocalhost=</i> for
details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>CacheFromLocalhost=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean as argument. If &quot;no&quot; (the default), and
response cames from host-local IP address (such as 127.0.0.1
or ::1), the result wouldn't be cached in order to avoid
potential duplicate local caching.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>DNSStubListener=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or one of &quot;udp&quot; and
&quot;tcp&quot;. If &quot;udp&quot;, a DNS stub resolver
will listen for UDP requests on address 127.0.0.53 port 53.
If &quot;tcp&quot;, the stub will listen for TCP requests on
the same address and port. If &quot;yes&quot; (the default),
the stub listens for both UDP and TCP requests. If
&quot;no&quot;, the stub listener is disabled.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that the DNS stub listener is turned off implicitly when its
listening address and port are already in use.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>DNSStubListenerExtra=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes an
IPv4 or IPv6 address to listen on. The address may be
optionally prefixed with a protocol name (&quot;udp&quot; or
&quot;tcp&quot;) separated with &quot;:&quot;. If the
protocol is not specified, the service will listen on both
UDP and TCP. It may be also optionally suffixed by a numeric
port number with separator &quot;:&quot;. When an IPv6
address is specified with a port number, then the address
must be in the square brackets. If the port is not
specified, then the service uses port 53. Note that this is
independent of the primary DNS stub configured with
<i>DNSStubListener=</i>, and only configures
<i>additional</i> sockets to listen on. This option can be
specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned,
then the all previous assignments are cleared. Defaults to
unset.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Examples:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">DNSStubListenerExtra=192.168.10.10

DNSStubListenerExtra=2001:db8:0:f102::10 <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ReadEtcHosts=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. If &quot;yes&quot; (the default),
<b>systemd-resolved</b> will read /etc/hosts, and try to
resolve hosts or address by using the entries in the file
before sending query to DNS servers.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ResolveUnicastSingleLabel=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. When false (the default),
<b>systemd-resolved</b> will not resolve A and AAAA queries
for single-label names over classic DNS. Note that such
names may still be resolved if search domains are specified
(see <i>Domains=</i> above), or using other mechanisms, in
particular via LLMNR or from /etc/hosts. When true, queries
for single-label names will be forwarded to global DNS
servers even if no search domains are defined.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option is provided for compatibility with configurations
where <i>public DNS servers are not used</i>. Forwarding
