<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Net::DBus::Tutorial::ExportingObjects
- tutorials on providing a DBus service</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
provides a tutorial on providing a DBus service using the
Perl Net::DBus application bindings. This examples in this
document will be based on the code from the Music::Player
distribution, which is a simple DBus service providing a
music track player.</p>

<h2>CREATING AN OBJECT
<a name="CREATING AN OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first step
in creating an object is to create a new package which
inherits from Net::DBus::Object. The Music::Player::Manager
object provides an <small>API</small> for managing the
collection of music player backends for different track
types. To start with, lets create the skeleton of the
package &amp; its constructor. The constructor of the super
type, Net::DBus::Object expects to be given to parameters, a
handle to the Net::DBus::Service owning the object, and a
path under which the object shall be exported. Since the
manager class is intended to be a singleton object, we can
hard code the path to it within the constructor:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package
Music::Player::Manager; <br>
use base qw(Net::DBus::Object); <br>
sub new { <br>
my $class = shift; <br>
my $service = shift; <br>
my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new($service,
&quot;/music/player/manager&quot;); <br>
bless $self, $class; <br>
return $self; <br>
} <br>
1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, as
mentioned, the manager with handle a number of different
player backends. So we need to provide methods for
registering new backends, and querying for backends capable
of playing a particular file type. So modifying the above
code we add a hash table in the constructor, to store the
backends:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub new { <br>
my $class = shift; <br>
my $service = shift; <br>
my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new($service,
&quot;/music/player/manager&quot;); <br>
$self-&gt;{backends} = {}; <br>
bless $self, $class; <br>
return $self; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And now a
method to register a new backend. This takes a Perl module
name and uses it to instantiate a backend. Since the
backends are also going to be DBus objects, we need to pass
in a reference to the service we are attached to, along with
a path under which to register the backend. We use the
&quot;get_service&quot; method to retreieve a reference to
the service the manager is attached to, and attach the
player backend to this same service: When a method on DBus
object is invoked, the first parameter is the object
reference ($self), and the remainder are the parameters
provided to the method call. Thus writing a method
implementation on a DBUs is really no different to normal
object oriented Perl (cf perltoot):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub
register_backend { <br>
my $self = shift; <br>
my $name = shift; <br>
my $module = shift; <br>
eval &quot;use $module&quot;; <br>
if ($@) { <br>
die &quot;cannot load backend $module: $@&quot; ; <br>
} <br>
$self-&gt;{backends}-&gt;{$name} =
$module-&gt;new($self-&gt;get_service, <br>
&quot;/music/player/backend/$name&quot;); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Looking at this
one might wonder what happens if the &quot;die&quot; method
is triggered. In such a scenario, rather than terminating
the service process, the error will be caught and propagated
back to the remote caller to deal with.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The player
backends provide a method &quot;get_track_types&quot; which
returns an array reference of the music track types they
support. We can use this method to provide an
<small>API</small> to allow easy retrieval of a backend for
a particular track type. This method will return a path with
which the backend object can be accessed</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub
find_backend { <br>
my $self = shift; <br>
my $extension = shift; <br>
foreach my $name (keys %{$self-&gt;{backends}}) { <br>
my $backend = $self-&gt;{backends}-&gt;{$name}; <br>
foreach my $type (@{$backend-&gt;get_track_types}) { <br>
if ($type eq $extension) { <br>
return $backend-&gt;get_object_path; <br>
} <br>
} <br>
} <br>
die &quot;no backend for type $extension&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lets take a
quick moment to consider how this method would be used to
play a music track. If you&rsquo;ve not already done so,
refresh your memory from Net::DBus::Tutorial::UsingObjects.
Now, we have an <small>MP3</small> file which we wish to
play, so we search for the path to a backend, then retrieve
the object for it, and play the track:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">...get the
music player service... <br>
# Ask for a path to a player for mp3 files <br>
my $path = $service-&gt;find_backend(&quot;mp3&quot;); <br>
# $path now contains '/music/player/backend/mpg123' <br>
# and we can get the backend object <br>
my $backend = $service-&gt;get_object($path); <br>
# and finally play the track <br>

$backend-&gt;play(&quot;/vol/music/beck/guero/09-scarecrow.mp3&quot;);</p>

<h2>PROVIDING INTROSPECTION DATA
<a name="PROVIDING INTROSPECTION DATA"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The code above
is a complete working object, ready to be registered with a
service, and since the parameters and return values for the
two methods are both simple strings we could stop there. In
some cases, however, one might want to be more specific
about data types expected for parameters, for example signed
vs unsigned integers. Adding explicit data typing also makes
interaction with other programming languages more reliable.
Providing explicit data type definitions for exported method
is known in the DBus world as &quot;Introspection&quot;, and
it makes life much more reliable for users of one&rsquo;s
service whom may be using a strongly typed language such as
C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first step
in providing introspection data for a DBus object in Perl,
is to specify the name of the interface provided by the
object. This is typically a period separated string, by
convention containing the domain name of the application as
its first component. Since most Perl modules end up living
on <small>CPAN,</small> one might use &quot;org.cpan&quot;
as the first component, followed by the package name of the
module (replacing :: with .), eg
&quot;org.cpan.music.player.manager&quot;. If it is not
planned to host the module on <small>CPAN,</small> a
personal/project domain might be used eg
&quot;com.berrange.music.player.manager&quot;. The interface
for an object is defined by loading the Net::DBus::Exporter
module, providing the interface as its first parameter. So
the earlier code example would be modified to look like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package
Music::Player::Manager; <br>
use base qw(Net::DBus); <br>
use Net::DBus::Exporter
qw(com.berrange.music.player.manager)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Next up, it is
necessary to provide data types for the parameters and
return values of the methods. The Net::DBus::Exporter module
provides a method &quot;dbus_method&quot; for this purpose,
which takes three parameter, the name of the method being
exported, an array reference of parameter types, and an
array reference of return types (the latter can be omitted
if there are no return values). This can be called at any
point in the module&rsquo;s code, but by convention it is
preferable to associate calls to &quot;dbus_method&quot;
with the actual method implementation, thus:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dbus_method(&quot;register_backend&quot;,
[&quot;string&quot;, &quot;string&quot;]); <br>
sub register_backend { <br>
my $self = shift; <br>
my $name = shift; <br>
my $module = shift; <br>
.. snipped rest of method body ... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And, thus:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dbus_method(&quot;find_backend&quot;,
[&quot;string&quot;], [&quot;string&quot;]) <br>
sub find_backend { <br>
my $self = shift; <br>
my $extension = shift; <br>
... snip method body... <br>
}</p>

<h2>DEFINING A SERVICE
<a name="DEFINING A SERVICE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now that the
objects have been written, it is time to define a service. A
service is nothing more than a well known name for a given
<small>API</small> contract. A contract can be thought of as
a definition of a list of object paths, and the
corresponding interfaces they provide. So, someone else
could come along a provide an alternate music player
implementation using the Python or <small>QT</small>
bindings for DBus, and if they provided the same set of
object paths &amp; interfaces, they could justifiably
register the same service on the bus.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
Net::DBus::Service module provides the means to register a
service. Its constructor expects a reference to the bus
object (an instance of Net::DBus), along with the name of
the service. As with interface names, the first component of
a service name is usually derived from a domain name, and
then suffixed with the name of the application, in our
example forming &quot;org.cpan.Music.Player&quot;. While
some objects will be created on the fly during execution of
the application, others are created upon initial startup.
The music player manager object created earlier in this
tutorial is an example of the latter. It is typical to
instantiate and register these objects in the constructor
for the service. Thus a service object for the music player
application would look like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package
Music::Player; <br>
use base qw(Net::DBus::Service); <br>
sub new { <br>
my $class = shift; <br>
my $bus = shift; <br>
my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new($bus,
&quot;org.cpan.music.player&quot;); <br>
bless $self, $class; <br>
$self-&gt;{manager} = Music::Player::Manager-&gt;new($self);
<br>
return $self; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
Net::DBus::Service automatically provides one special object
to all services, under the path
&quot;/org/freedesktop/DBus/Exporter&quot;. This object
implements the &quot;org.freedesktop.DBus.Exporter&quot;
interface which has a method &quot;ListObject&quot;. This
enables clients to determine a list of all objects exported
within a service. While not functionally necessary for most
applications, it is none-the-less a useful tool for
developers debugging applications, or wondering what a
service provides.</p>

<h2>CONNECTING TO THE BUS
<a name="CONNECTING TO THE BUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The final step
in getting our service up and running is to connect it to
the bus. This brings up an interesting conundrum, does one
export the service on the system bus (shared by all users
&amp; processes on the machine), or the session bus (one per
user logged into a machine). In some cases the answer, with
only one of the two buses conceptually making sense. In
other cases, however, both the session &amp; system bus are
valid. In the former one would use the &quot;session&quot;
or &lt;system&gt; methods on Net::DBus to get a handle to
the desired bus, while in the latter case, the
&quot;find&quot; method would be used. This applies a
heuristic to determine the correct bus based on execution
environment. In the case of the music player, either bus is
relevant, so the code to connect the service to the bus
would look like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use Net::DBus;
<br>
my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find; <br>
my $player = Music::Player-&gt;new($bus);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the
service attached to the bus, it is merely necessary to run
the main event processing loop to listen out for &amp;
handle incoming DBus messages. So the above code is modified
to start a simple reactor:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use Net::DBus;
<br>
use Net::DBus::Reactor; <br>
my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find; <br>
my $player = Music::Player-&gt;new($bus); <br>
Net::DBus::Reactor-&gt;main-&gt;run; <br>
exit 0;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Saving this
code into a script &quot;/usr/bin/music-player.pl&quot;,
coding is complete and the service ready for use by clients
on the bus.</p>

<h2>SERVICE ACTIVATION
<a name="SERVICE ACTIVATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One might now
wonder how best to start the service, particularly if it is
a service capable of running on both the system and session
buses. DBus has the answer in the concept of
&quot;activation&quot;. What happens is that when a client
on the bus attempts to call a method, or register a signal
handler against, a service not currently running, it will
first try and start the service. Service&rsquo;s which wish
to participate in this process merely need stick a simple
service definition file into the directory
&quot;/usr/share/dbus-1/services&quot;. The file should be
named to match the service name, with the file extension
&quot;.service&quot; appended. eg,
&quot;/usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.cpan.music.player.service&quot;
The file contains two keys, first the name of the service,
and second the name of the executable used to run the
service, or in this case the Perl script. So, for our simple
service the data file would contain:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[D-BUS Service]
<br>
Name=org.cpan.music.player <br>
Exec=/usr/bin/music-player.pl</p>
