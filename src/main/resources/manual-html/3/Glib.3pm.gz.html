<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Glib - Perl
wrappers for the GLib utility and Object libraries</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use Glib;</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT
<a name="ABSTRACT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
provides perl access to GLib and GLib&rsquo;s GObject
libraries. GLib is a portability and utility library;
GObject provides a generic type system with inheritance and
a powerful signal system. Together these libraries are used
as the foundation for many of the libraries that make up the
Gnome environment, and are used in many unrelated
projects.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This wrapper
attempts to provide a perlish interface while remaining as
true as possible to the underlying C <small>API,</small> so
that any reference materials you can find on using GLib may
still apply to using the libraries from perl. This module
also provides facilities for creating wrappers for other
GObject-based libraries. The &quot; <small>SEE
ALSO&quot;</small> section contains pointers to all sorts of
good information.</p>

<h2>PERL VERSUS C
<a name="PERL VERSUS C"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GLib provides
to C programs many of the same facilities Perl offers
natively. Where GLib&rsquo;s functionality overlaps
Perl&rsquo;s, Perl&rsquo;s is favored. Some concepts have
been eliminated entirely, as Perl is a higher-level language
than C. In other instances we&rsquo;ve had to add or change
APIs to make sense in Perl. Here&rsquo;s a quick
run-down:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl Already
Does That</b> <br>
The GLib types GList (a doubly-linked list), GSList
(singly-linked list), GHashTable, GArray, etc have all been
replaced by native Perl datatypes. In fact, many functions
which take GLists or arrays simply accept lists on the Perl
stack. For the most part, GIOChannels are no more functional
than Perl file handles, so you won&rsquo;t see any
GIOChannels. GClosures are not visible at the Perl level,
because Perl code references do the same thing. Just about
any function taking either a C function pointer or a
GClosure will accept a code reference in Perl. (In fact, you
can probably get away with just a subroutine name in many
spots, provided you aren&rsquo;t using strict subs.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Don&rsquo;t
Worry About That</b> <br>
Some concepts have been eliminated; you need never worry
about reference-counting on GObjects or having to free
GBoxed structures. Perl is a garbage-collected language, and
we&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into making the bindings take
care of memory for you in a way that feels natural to a Perl
developer. You won&rsquo;t see GValues in Perl (that&rsquo;s
just a C structure with Perl scalar envy, anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>This Is Now
That</b> <br>
Other GLib concepts have been converted to an analogous Perl
concept.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The GType id
will never be seen in Perl, as the package name serves that
purpose. Several packages corresponding to the GTypes of the
fundamental types have been registered for you:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">G_TYPE_STRING
Glib::String <br>
G_TYPE_INT Glib::Int <br>
G_TYPE_UINT Glib::UInt <br>
G_TYPE_DOUBLE Glib::Double <br>
G_TYPE_BOOLEAN Glib::Boolean</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The remaining
fundamentals (char/uchar, short, float, etc) are also
registered so that we can properly interact with properties
of C objects, but perl really only uses ints, uints, and
doubles. Oh, and we created a GBoxed type for Perl scalars
so you can use scalars where any boxed type would be allowed
(e.g. GtkTreeModel columns):</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Glib::Scalar</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Functions that
can return false and set a GError in C raise an exception in
Perl, using an exception object based on the GError for $@;
see Glib::Error. Trapping exceptions in signals is a sticky
issue, so they get their own section; see
<small>EXCEPTIONS</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Enumerations
and flags are treated as strings and arrays of strings,
respectively. GLib provides a way to register nicknames for
enumeration values, and the Perl bindings use these
nicknames for the real values, so that we never have to deal
with numbers in Perl. This can get a little cumbersome for
bitfields, but it&rsquo;s very nice when you forget a flag
value, as the bindings will tell you what values are
accepted when you pass something invalid. Also, the bindings
consider the - and _ characters to be equivalent, so that
signal and property names can be properly stringified by the
=&gt; operator. For example, the following are
equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># property
foo-matic of type FooType, using the <br>
# value FOO_SOMETHING_COOL. its nickname would be <br>
# 'something-cool'. you may use either the full <br>
# name or the nickname when supplying values to perl. <br>
$object-&gt;set ('foo-matic', 'FOO_SOMETHING_COOL'); <br>
$object-&gt;set ('foo_matic', 'something_cool'); <br>
$object-&gt;set (foo_matic =&gt; 'something-cool');</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Beware that
Perl will always return to you the nickname form, with the
dash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Flags have some
additional magic abilities in the form of overloaded
operators:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">+ or | union of
two flagsets (&quot;add&quot;) <br>
- difference of two flagsets (&quot;sub&quot;,
&quot;remove&quot;) <br>
* or &amp; intersection of two bitsets (&quot;and&quot;)
<br>
/ or ^ symmetric difference (&quot;xor&quot;, you will
rarely need this) <br>
&gt;= contains-operator (&quot;is the left set a superset of
the right set?&quot;) <br>
== equality</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
flags in boolean context indicate whether they are empty or
not, which allows you to write common operations
naturally:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$widget-&gt;set_events
($widget-&gt;get_events - &quot;motion_notify_mask&quot;);
<br>
$widget-&gt;set_events ($widget-&gt;get_events -
[&quot;motion_notify_mask&quot;, <br>
&quot;button_press_mask&quot;]); <br>
# shift pressed (both work, it's a matter of taste) <br>
if ($event-&gt;state &gt;= &quot;shift-mask&quot;) { ...
<br>
if ($event-&gt;state * &quot;shift-mask&quot;) { ... <br>
# either shift OR control pressed? <br>
if ($event-&gt;state * [&quot;shift-mask&quot;,
&quot;control-mask&quot;]) { ... <br>
# both shift AND control pressed? <br>
if ($event-&gt;state &gt;= [&quot;shift-mask&quot;,
&quot;control-mask&quot;]) { ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
&quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; work as expected to add or
remove flags. To test whether <i>any</i> bits are set in a
mask, you use &quot;$mask * ...&quot;, and to test whether
<i>all</i> bits are set in a mask, you use &quot;$mask &gt;=
...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
dereferenced as an array @$flags or
&quot;$flags-&gt;[...]&quot;, you can access the flag values
directly as strings (but you are not allowed to modify the
array), and when stringified &quot;$flags&quot; a flags
value will output a human-readable version of its
contents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>It&rsquo;s
All the Same</b> <br>
For the most part, the remaining bits of GLib are unchanged.
GMainLoop is now Glib::MainLoop, GObject is now
Glib::Object, GBoxed is now Glib::Boxed, etc.</p>

<h2>FILENAMES, URIS AND ENCODINGS
<a name="FILENAMES, URIS AND ENCODINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl knows two
datatypes, unicode text and binary bytes. Filenames on a
system that doesn&rsquo;t use a utf-8 locale are often
stored in a local encoding (&quot;binary bytes&quot;). Gtk+
and descendants, however, internally work in unicode most of
the time, so when feeding a filename into a GLib/Gtk+
function that expects a filename, you first need to convert
it from the local encoding to unicode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This involves
some elaborate guessing, which perl currently avoids, but
GLib and Gtk+ do. As an exception, some Gtk+ functions want
a filename in local encoding, but the perl interface usually
works around this by automatically converting it for
you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In short:
Everything should be in unicode on the perl level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
functions expose the conversion algorithm that GLib
uses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
are only necessary when you want to use perl functions to
manage filenames returned by a GLib/Gtk+ function, or when
you feed filenames into GLib/Gtk+ functions that have their
source outside your program (e.g. commandline arguments,
readdir results etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
are available as exports by request (see
&quot;Exports&quot;), and also support method invocation
syntax for pathological consistency with the
<small>OO</small> syntax of the rest of the bindings. <br>
$filename = filename_to_unicode $filename_in_local_encoding
<br>
$filename = Glib-&gt;filename_to_unicode
($filename_in_local_encoding)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Convert a perl string that
supposedly contains a filename in local encoding into a
filename represented as unicode, the same way that GLib does
it internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$gtkfilesel-&gt;set_filename
(filename_to_unicode $ARGV[1]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This function
will <b>croak()</b> if the conversion cannot be made, e.g.,
because the utf-8 is invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$filename_in_local_encoding =
filename_from_unicode $filename <br>
$filename_in_local_encoding = Glib-&gt;filename_from_unicode
($filename)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Converts a perl string
containing a filename into a filename in the local encoding
in the same way GLib does it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">open MY,
&quot;&lt;&quot;, filename_from_unicode
$gtkfilesel-&gt;get_filename;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It might be
useful to know that perl currently has no policy at all
regarding filename issues, if your scalar happens to be in
utf-8 internally it will use utf-8, if it happens to be
stored as bytes, it will use it as-is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When dealing
with filenames that you need to display, there is a much
easier way, as of Glib 1.120 and glib 2.6.0: <br>
$uft8_string = filename_display_name ($filename) <br>
$uft8_string = filename_display_basename ($filename)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Given a <i>$filename</i> in
filename encoding, return the filename, or just the
file&rsquo;s basename, in utf-8. Unlike the other functions
described above, this one is guaranteed to return valid
utf-8, but the conversion is not necessarily reversible.
These functions are intended to be used for failsafe display
of filenames, for example in gtk+ labels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since glib 2.6,
Glib 1.12</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
convert filenames to and from <small>URI</small> encoding.
(See also URI::file.) <br>
$string = filename_to_uri ($filename, $hostname) <br>
$string = Glib-&gt;filename_to_uri ($filename,
$hostname)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Return a &quot;file://&quot;
schema <small>URI</small> for a filename. Unsafe and
non-ascii chars in $filename are escaped with
<small>URI</small> &quot;%&quot; forms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$filename must
be an absolute path as a byte string in local filesystem
encoding. $hostname is a utf-8 string, or empty or
&quot;undef&quot; for no host specified. For example,</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">filename_to_uri
('/my/x%y/&lt;dir&gt;/foo.html', undef); <br>
# returns 'file:///my/x%25y/%3Cdir%3E/foo.html'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If $filename is
a relative path or $hostname doesn&rsquo;t look like a
hostname then &quot;filename_to_uri&quot; croaks with a
&quot;Glib::Error&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
class style &quot;Glib-&gt;filename_to_uri&quot; remember
that the $hostname argument is mandatory. If you forget then
it looks like a 2-argument call with filename of
&quot;Glib&quot; and hostname of what you meant to be the
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$filename = filename_from_uri
($uri) <br>
($filename, $hostname) = filename_from_uri ($uri)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Extract the filename and
hostname from a &quot;file://&quot; schema
<small>URI.</small> In scalar context just the filename is
returned, in array context both filename and hostname are
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The filename
returned is bytes in the local filesystem encoding and with
the <small>OS</small> path separator character. The hostname
returned is utf-8. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">($f,$h) =
filename_from_uri ('file://foo.com/r%26b/bar.html'); <br>
# returns '/r&amp;b/bar.html' and 'foo.com' on Unix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If $uri is not
a &quot;file:&quot;, or is mal-formed, or the hostname part
doesn&rsquo;t look like a host name then
&quot;filename_from_uri&quot; croaks with a
&quot;Glib::Error&quot;.</p>

<h2>EXCEPTIONS
<a name="EXCEPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The C language
doesn&rsquo;t support exceptions; GLib is a C library, and
of course doesn&rsquo;t support exceptions either. In Perl,
we use die and eval to raise and trap exceptions as a rather
common practice. So, the bindings have to work a little
black magic behind the scenes to keep GLib from exploding
when the Perl program uses exceptions. Unfortunately, a
little of this magic has to leak out to where you can see it
at the Perl level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Signal and
event handlers are run in an eval context; if an exception
occurs in such a handler and you don&rsquo;t catch it, Perl
will report that an error occurred, and then go on about its
business like nothing happened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may
register subroutines as exception handlers, to be called
when such an exception is trapped. Another function removes
them for you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$tag =
Glib-&gt;install_exception_handler (\&amp;my_handler); <br>
Glib-&gt;remove_exception_handler ($tag);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exception
handler will get a fresh copy of the $@ of the offending
exception on the argument stack, and is expected to return
non-zero if the handler is to remain installed. If it
returns false, the handler will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub my_handler
{ <br>
if ($_[0] =~ m/ftang quisinart/) { <br>
clean_up_after_ftang (); <br>
} <br>
1; # live to fight another day <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can
register as many handlers as you like; they will all run
independently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An important
thing to remember is that exceptions do not cross main
loops. In fact, exceptions are completely distinct from main
loops. If you need to quit a main loop when an exception
occurs, install a handler that quits the main loop, but also
ask yourself if you are using exceptions for flow control or
exception handling.</p>

<h2>LOG MESSAGES
<a name="LOG MESSAGES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GLib&rsquo;s
g_log function provides a flexible mechanism for reporting
messages, and most GLib-based C libraries use this mechanism
for warnings, assertions, critical messages, etc. The Perl
bindings offer a mechanism for routing these messages
through Perl&rsquo;s native system, <b>warn()</b> and
<b>die()</b>. Extensions should register the log domains
they wrap for this to happen fluidly. [ <small>FIXME</small>
say more here]</p>

<h2>64 BIT INTEGERS
<a name="64 BIT INTEGERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
perl&rsquo;s integer data type can only hold 32 bit values
on all 32 bit machines and even on some 64 bit machines,
Glib converts 64 bit integers to and from strings if
necessary. These strings can then be used to feed one of the
various big integer modules. Make sure you don&rsquo;t let
your strings get into numerical context before passing them
into a Glib function because in this case, perl will convert
the number to scientific notation which at this point is not
understood by Glib&rsquo;s converters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
overview of what big integer modules are available. First of
all, there&rsquo;s Math::BigInt. It has everything you will
ever need, but its pure-Perl implementation is also rather
slow. There are multiple ways around this, though. <br>
Math::BigInt::FastCalc</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Math::BigInt::FastCalc can help
avoid the glacial speed of vanilla Math::BigInt::Calc.
Recent versions of Math::BigInt will automatically use
Math::BigInt::FastCalc in place of Math::BigInt::Calc when
available. Other options include Math::BigInt::GMP or
Math::BigInt::Pari, which however have much larger
dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Math::BigInt::Lite</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Then there&rsquo;s
Math::BigInt::Lite, which uses native Perl integer
operations as long as Perl integers have sufficient range,
and upgrades itself to Math::BigInt when Perl integers would
overflow. This must be used in place of Math::BigInt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bigint / bignum / bigfloat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Finally, there&rsquo;s the
bigint/bignum/bigfloat pragmata, which automatically load
the corresponding Math:: modules and which will autobox
constants. bignum/bigint will automatically use
Math::BigInt::Lite if it&rsquo;s available.</p>

<h2>EXPORTS
<a name="EXPORTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the most
part, gtk2-perl avoids exporting things. Nothing is exported
by default, but some functions and constants in Glib are
available by request; you can also get all of them with the
export tag &quot;all&quot;. <br>
