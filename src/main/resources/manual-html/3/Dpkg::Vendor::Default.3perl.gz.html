<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Dpkg::Vendor::Default
- default vendor class</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A vendor class
is used to provide vendor specific behaviour in various
places. This is the default class used in case there&rsquo;s
none for the current vendor or in case the vendor could not
be identified (see Dpkg::Vendor documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It provides
some hooks that are called by various dpkg-* tools. If you
need a new hook, please file a bug against dpkg-dev and
explain your need. Note that the hook <small>API</small> has
no guarantee to be stable over an extended period of time.
If you run an important distribution that makes use of
vendor hooks, you&rsquo;d better submit them for integration
so that we avoid breaking your code.</p>

<h2>METHODS
<a name="METHODS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$vendor_obj =
Dpkg::Vendor::Default-&gt;<b>new()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Creates the default vendor
object. Can be inherited by all vendor objects if they
don&rsquo;t need any specific initialization at object
creation time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$vendor_obj-&gt;run_hook($id,
@params)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Run the corresponding hook. The
parameters are hook-specific. The supported hooks are: <br>
before-source-build ($srcpkg)</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The first parameter is a
Dpkg::Source::Package object. The hook is called just before
the execution of $srcpkg-&gt;<b>build()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">package-keyrings ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called when
dpkg-source is checking a signature on a source package
(since dpkg 1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a
(possibly empty) list of vendor-specific keyrings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">archive-keyrings ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called when there
is a need to check signatures on artifacts from
repositories, for example by a download method (since dpkg
1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly
empty) list of vendor-specific keyrings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">archive-keyrings-historic
()</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called when there
is a need to check signatures on artifacts from historic
repositories, for example by a download method (since dpkg
1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly
empty) list of vendor-specific keyrings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">builtin-build-depends ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called when
dpkg-checkbuilddeps is initializing the source package build
dependencies (since dpkg 1.18.2). It takes no parameters,
but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific
<b>Build-Depends</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">builtin-build-conflicts ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called when
dpkg-checkbuilddeps is initializing the source package build
conflicts (since dpkg 1.18.2). It takes no parameters, but
returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific
<b>Build-Conflicts</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">register-custom-fields ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called in
Dpkg::Control::Fields to register custom fields. You should
return a list of arrays. Each array is an operation to
perform. The first item is the name of the operation and
corresponds to a field_* function provided by
Dpkg::Control::Fields. The remaining fields are the
parameters that are passed unchanged to the corresponding
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">Known
operations are &quot;register&quot;,
&quot;insert_after&quot; and &quot;insert_before&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">post-process-changelog-entry
($fields)</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called in
Dpkg::Changelog to post-process a Dpkg::Changelog::Entry
after it has been created and filled with the appropriate
values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">update-buildflags ($flags)</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called in
Dpkg::BuildFlags to allow the vendor to override the default
values set for the various build flags. $flags is a
Dpkg::BuildFlags object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">update-buildprofiles
($build_profiles_ref)</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called in
Dpkg::BuildProfiles to allow the vendor to override the
default values set. $build_profiles_ref is a array ref to
Dpkg::BuildProfiles object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">builtin-system-build-paths
()</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called by
dpkg-genbuildinfo to determine if the current path should be
recorded in the <b>Build-Path</b> field (since dpkg
1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly
empty) list of root paths considered acceptable. As an
example, if the list contains &quot;/build/&quot;, a
Build-Path field will be created if the current directory is
&quot;/build/dpkg-1.18.0&quot;. If the list contains
&quot;/&quot;, the path will always be recorded. If the list
is empty, the current path will never be recorded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">build-tainted-by ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called by
dpkg-genbuildinfo to determine if the current system has
been tainted in some way that could affect the resulting
build, which will be recorded in the <b>Build-Tainted-By</b>
field (since dpkg 1.19.5). It takes no parameters, but
returns a (possibly empty) list of tainted reason tags
(formed by alphanumeric and dash characters).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">sanitize-environment ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The hook is called by
dpkg-buildpackage to sanitize its build environment (since
dpkg 1.20.0).</p>
