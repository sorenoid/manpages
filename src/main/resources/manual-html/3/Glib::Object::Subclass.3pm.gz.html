<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
allows you to create your own GObject classes, which is
useful to e.g. implement your own Gtk2 widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It
doesn&rsquo;t &quot;export&quot; anything into your
namespace, but acts more like a pragmatic module that
modifies your class to make it work as a GObject class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may be
wondering why you can&rsquo;t just bless a Glib::Object into
a different package and add some subs. Well, if you
aren&rsquo;t interested in object parameters, signals, or
having your new class interoperate transparently with other
GObject-based modules (e.g., Gtk2 and friends), then you can
just re-bless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, a
GObject&rsquo;s signals, properties, virtual functions, and
GInterface implementations are specific to its GObjectClass.
If you want to create a new GObject which was a derivative
of GtkDrawingArea, but adds a new signal, you must create a
new GObjectClass to which to add the new signal. If you
don&rsquo;t, then <i>all</i> of the GtkDrawingAreas in your
application will get that new signal!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus, the only
way to create a new signal or object property in the Perl
bindings for Glib is to register a new subclass with the
GLib type system via <b>Glib::Type::register_object()</b>.
The Glib::Object::Subclass module is a
Perl-developer-friendly interface to this bit of paradigm
mismatch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>USAGE</small></b>
<br>
This module works similar to the &quot;use base&quot; pragma
in that it registers the current package as a subclass of
some other class (which must be a GObjectClass implemented
either in C or some other language).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pragma
requires at least one argument, the parent class name. The
remaining arguments are key/value pairs, in any order, all
optional: <br>
- properties =&gt; []</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add object properties; see
&quot; <small>PROPERTIES&quot;</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">- signals =&gt; {}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add or override signals; see
&quot; <small>SIGNALS&quot;</small> and &quot;
<small>OVERRIDING BASE METHODS&quot;</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">- interfaces =&gt; []</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add GInterfaces to your class;
see &quot; <small>INTERFACES&quot;</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Actually,
these parameters are all passed straight through to
<b>Glib::Type::register_object()</b>, adding __PACKAGE__
(the current package name) as the name of the new child
class.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>OBJECT
METHODS AND FUNCTIONS</small></b> <br>
The following methods are either added to your class on
request (not yet implemented), or by default unless your own
class implements them itself. This means that all these
methods and functions will get sensible default
implementations unless explicitly overwritten by you (by
defining your own version).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Except for
&quot;new&quot;, all of the following are <i>functions</i>
and no <i>methods</i>. That means that you should <i>not</i>
call the superclass method. Instead, the GObject system will
call these functions per class as required, emulating normal
inheritance. <br>
$class-&gt;new (attr =&gt; value, ...)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default constructor just
calls &quot;Glib::Object::new&quot;, which allows you to set
properties on the newly created object. This is done because
many &quot;new&quot; methods inherited by Gtk2 or other
libraries don&rsquo;t have &quot;new&quot; methods suitable
for subclassing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>INIT_INSTANCE</small>
$self [not a method]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;INIT_INSTANCE&quot; is
called on each class in the hierarchy as the object is being
created (i.e., from &quot;Glib::Object::new&quot; or our
default &quot;new&quot;). Use this function to initialize
any member data. The default implementation will leave the
object untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>GET_PROPERTY</small>
$self, $pspec [not a method] <small><br>
SET_PROPERTY</small> $self, $pspec, $newval [not a
method]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;GET_PROPERTY&quot; and
&quot;SET_PROPERTY&quot; are called whenever somebody does
&quot;$object-&gt;get ($propname)&quot; or
&quot;$object-&gt;set ($propname =&gt; $newval)&quot; (from
other languages, too). The default implementations hold
property values in the object hash, equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub
GET_PROPERTY { <br>
my ($self, $pspec) = @_; <br>
my $pname = $pspec-&gt;get_name; <br>
return (exists $self-&gt;{$pname} ? $self-&gt;{$pname} <br>
: $pspec-&gt;get_default_value); # until set <br>
} <br>
sub SET_PROPERTY { <br>
my ($self, $pspec, $newval) = @_; <br>
$self-&gt;{$pspec-&gt;get_name} = $newval; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because
&quot;$pspec-&gt;get_name&quot; converts hyphens to
underscores, a property &quot;line-style&quot; is in the
hash as &quot;line_style&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These methods
let you store/fetch properties in any way you need to. They
don&rsquo;t have to be in the hash, you can calculate
something, read a file, whatever.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Most often
you&rsquo;ll write your own &quot;SET_PROPERTY&quot; so you
can take action when a property changes, like redraw or
resize a widget. Eg.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub
SET_PROPERTY { <br>
my ($self, $pspec, $newval) = @_; <br>
my $pname = $pspec-&gt;get_name <br>
$self-&gt;{$pname} = $newval; # ready for default
GET_PROPERTY <br>
if ($pname eq 'line_style') { <br>
$self-&gt;queue_draw; # redraw with new lines <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Care must be
taken with boxed non-reference-counted types such as
&quot;Gtk2::Gdk::Color&quot;. In &quot;SET_PROPERTY&quot;
the $newval is generally good only for the duration of the
call. Use &quot;copy&quot; or similar if keeping it longer
(see Glib::Boxed). In &quot;GET_PROPERTY&quot; the returned
memory must last long enough to reach the caller, which
generally means returning a field, not a newly created
object (which is destroyed with the scalar holding it).</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;GET_PROPERTY&quot;
is different from a C get_property method in that the perl
method returns the retrieved value. For symmetry, the
$newval and $pspec args on &quot;SET_PROPERTY&quot; are
swapped from the C usage.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>FINALIZE_INSTANCE</small>
$self [not a method]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;FINALIZE_INSTANCE&quot;
is called as the GObject is being finalized, that is, as it
is being really destroyed. This is independent of the more
common <small>DESTROY</small> on the perl object; in fact,
you must <i><small>NOT</small></i> override
&quot;DESTROY&quot; (it&rsquo;s not useful to you, in any
case, as it is being called multiple times!).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use this hook
to release anything you have to clean up manually.
<small>FINALIZE_INSTANCE</small> will be called for each
perl instance, in reverse order of construction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
finalizer does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$object-&gt;
<small>DESTROY</small> [ <small>DO NOT OVERWRITE</small>
]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t <i>ever</i>
overwrite &quot;DESTROY&quot;, use
&quot;FINALIZE_INSTANCE&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>DESTROY</small> method of all perl classes derived
from GTypes is implemented in the Glib module and (ab-)used
for its own internal purposes. Overwriting it is not useful
as it will be called <i>multiple</i> times, and often long
before the object actually gets destroyed. Overwriting might
be very harmful to your program, so <i>never</i> do that.
Especially watch out for other classes in your
<small>ISA</small> tree.</p>

<h2>PROPERTIES
<a name="PROPERTIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To create
gobject properties, supply a list of Glib::ParamSpec objects
as the value for the key &rsquo;properties&rsquo;. There are
lots of different paramspec constructors, documented in the
C <small>API</small> reference&rsquo;s Parameters and Values
page, as well as Glib::ParamSpec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Glib
1.060, you can also specify explicit getters and setters for
your properties at creation time. The default values in your
properties are also honored if you don&rsquo;t set anything
else. See Glib::Type::register_object in Glib::Type for an
example.</p>

<h2>SIGNALS
<a name="SIGNALS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Creating new
signals for your new object is easy. Just provide a hash of
signal names and signal descriptions under the key
&rsquo;signals&rsquo;. Each signal description is also a
hash, with a few expected keys. All the keys are allowed to
default. <br>
flags =&gt; GSignalFlags</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If not present, assumed to be
&rsquo;run-first&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">param_types =&gt; reference to
a list of package names</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If not present, assumed to be
empty (no parameters).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">class_closure =&gt; reference
to a subroutine to call as the class <br>
closure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">may also be a string
interpreted as the name of a subroutine to call, but you
should be very very very careful about that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If not present,
the library will attempt to call the method named
&quot;do_signal_name&quot; for the signal
&quot;signal_name&quot; (uses underscores).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You&rsquo;ll
want to be careful not to let this handler method be a
publically callable method, or one that has the name name as
something that emits the signal. Due to the funky ways in
which Glib is different from Perl, the class closures
<i>should not</i> inherit through normal perl
inheritance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">return_type =&gt; package name
for return value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If undefined or not present,
the signal expects no return value. if defined, the signal
is expected to return a value; flags must be set such that
the signal does not run only first (at least use
&rsquo;run-last&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">accumulator =&gt; signal return
value accumulator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">quoting the Glib manual:
&quot;The signal accumulator is a special callback function
that can be used to collect return values of the various
callbacks that are called during a signal
emission.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If not
specified, the default accumulator is used, and you just get
the return value of the last handler to run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Accumulators
are not really documented very much in the C reference, and
the perl interface here is slightly different, so
here&rsquo;s an inordinate amount of detail for this arcane
feature:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The accumulator
function is called for every handler as</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">($cont, $acc) =
&amp;$func ($invocation_hint, $acc, $ret)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$invocation_hint
is an anonymous hash (including the signal name); $acc is
the current accumulated return value; $ret is the value from
the most recent handler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The two return
values are a boolean $cont for whether signal emission
should continue (false to stop); and a new $acc accumulated
return value. (This is different from the C version, which
writes through a return_accu.)</p>

<h2>OVERRIDING BASE METHODS
<a name="OVERRIDING BASE METHODS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GLib pulls some
fancy tricks with function pointers to implement methods in
C. This is not very language-binding-friendly, as you might
guess.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, as
described above, every signal allows a &quot;class
closure&quot;; you may override the class closure with your
own function, and you can chain from the overridden method
to the original. This serves to implement virtual overrides
for language bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, to override
a method, you supply a subroutine reference instead of a
signal description hash as the value for the name of the
existing signal in the &quot;signals&quot; hash described in
&quot; <small>SIGNALS&quot;</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># override some
important widget methods: <br>
use Glib::Object::Subclass <br>
Gtk2::Widget::, <br>
signals =&gt; { <br>
expose_event =&gt; \&amp;expose_event, <br>
configure_event =&gt; \&amp;configure_event, <br>
button_press_event =&gt; \&amp;button_press_event, <br>
button_release_event =&gt; \&amp;button_release_event, <br>
motion_notify_event =&gt; \&amp;motion_notify_event, <br>
# note the choice of names here... see the discussion. <br>
size_request =&gt; \&amp;do_size_request, <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
important to note that the handlers you supply for these are
class-specific, and that normal perl method inheritance
rules are not followed to invoke them from within the
library. However, perl code can still find them! Therefore
it&rsquo;s rather important that you choose your
handlers&rsquo; names carefully, avoiding any public
interfaces that you might call from perl. Case in point,
since size_request is a widget method, i chose
do_size_request as the override handler.</p>

<h2>INTERFACES
<a name="INTERFACES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GObject
supports only single inheritance; in place of multiple
inheritance, GObject uses GInterfaces. In the Perl bindings
we have mostly masqueraded this with multiple inheritance
(that is, simply adding the GInterface class to the @ISA of
the implementing class), but in deriving new objects the
facade breaks and the magic leaks out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
derive an object that implements a GInterface, you have to
tell the GLib type system you want your class to include a
GInterface. To do this, simply pass a list of package names
through the &quot;interfaces&quot; key; this will add these
packages to your @ISA, and cause perl to invoke methods that
you must provide.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package
Mup::MultilineEntry; <br>
use Glib::Object::Subclass <br>
'Gtk2::TextView', <br>
interfaces =&gt; [ 'Gtk2::CellEditable' ], <br>
; <br>
# perl will now invoke these methods, which are part of the
<br>
# GtkCellEditable GInterface, when somebody invokes the <br>
# corresponding lower-case methods on your objects. <br>
sub START_EDITING { warn &quot;start editing\n&quot;; } <br>
sub EDITING_DONE { warn &quot;editing done\n&quot;; } <br>
sub REMOVE_WIDGET { warn &quot;remove widget\n&quot;; }</p>
