<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dlopen()</b>
<br>
The function <b>dlopen</b>() loads the dynamic shared object
(shared library) file named by the null-terminated string
<i>filename</i> and returns an opaque &quot;handle&quot; for
the loaded object. This handle is employed with other
functions in the dlopen API, such as <a href="https://man.page/3/dlsym">dlsym(3)</a>,
<a href="https://man.page/3/dladdr">dladdr(3)</a>, <a href="https://man.page/3/dlinfo">dlinfo(3)</a>, and
<b>dlclose</b>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>filename</i> is NULL, then the returned handle is for the
main program. If <i>filename</i> contains a slash
(&quot;/&quot;), then it is interpreted as a (relative or
absolute) pathname. Otherwise, the dynamic linker searches
for the object as follows (see <b>ld.so</b>(8) for further
details):</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>o</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>(ELF only) If the calling object (i.e., the shared
library or executable from which <b>dlopen</b>() is called)
contains a DT_RPATH tag, and does not contain a DT_RUNPATH
tag, then the directories listed in the DT_RPATH tag are
searched.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>o</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If, at the time that the program was started, the
environment variable <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> was defined to
contain a colon-separated list of directories, then these
are searched. (As a security measure, this variable is
ignored for set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.)</p></td></tr>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">

<p>The directories <i>/lib</i> and <i>/usr/lib</i> are

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the object
specified by <i>filename</i> has dependencies on other
shared objects, then these are also automatically loaded by
the dynamic linker using the same rules. (This process may
occur recursively, if those objects in turn have
dependencies, and so on.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of the
following two values must be included in <i>flags</i>:
<b><br>
RTLD_LAZY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Perform lazy binding. Resolve
symbols only as the code that references them is executed.
If the symbol is never referenced, then it is never
resolved. (Lazy binding is performed only for function
references; references to variables are always immediately
bound when the shared object is loaded.) Since glibc 2.1.1,
this flag is overridden by the effect of the
<b>LD_BIND_NOW</b> environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RTLD_NOW</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this value is specified, or
the environment variable <b>LD_BIND_NOW</b> is set to a
nonempty string, all undefined symbols in the shared object
are resolved before <b>dlopen</b>() returns. If this cannot
be done, an error is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Zero or more of
the following values may also be ORed in <i>flags</i>:
<b><br>
RTLD_GLOBAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The symbols defined by this
shared object will be made available for symbol resolution
of subsequently loaded shared objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RTLD_LOCAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the converse of
<b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>, and the default if neither flag is
specified. Symbols defined in this shared object are not
made available to resolve references in subsequently loaded
shared objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RTLD_NODELETE</b> (since
glibc 2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not unload the shared object
during <b>dlclose</b>(). Consequently, the object&rsquo;s
static and global variables are not reinitialized if the
object is reloaded with <b>dlopen</b>() at a later time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RTLD_NOLOAD</b> (since glibc
2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t load the shared
object. This can be used to test if the object is already
resident (<b>dlopen</b>() returns NULL if it is not, or the
object&rsquo;s handle if it is resident). This flag can also
be used to promote the flags on a shared object that is
already loaded. For example, a shared object that was
previously loaded with <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> can be reopened
with <b>RTLD_NOLOAD&nbsp;|&nbsp;RTLD_GLOBAL</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RTLD_DEEPBIND</b> (since
glibc 2.3.4)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Place the lookup scope of the
symbols in this shared object ahead of the global scope.
This means that a self-contained object will use its own
symbols in preference to global symbols with the same name
contained in objects that have already been loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>filename</i> is NULL, then the returned handle is for the
main program. When given to <a href="https://man.page/3/dlsym">dlsym(3)</a>, this handle
causes a search for a symbol in the main program, followed
by all shared objects loaded at program startup, and then
all shared objects loaded by <b>dlopen</b>() with the flag
<b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Symbol
references in the shared object are resolved using (in
order): symbols in the link map of objects loaded for the
main program and its dependencies; symbols in shared objects
(and their dependencies) that were previously opened with
<b>dlopen</b>() using the <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> flag; and
definitions in the shared object itself (and any
dependencies that were loaded for that object).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any global
symbols in the executable that were placed into its dynamic
symbol table by <a href="https://man.page/1/ld">ld(1)</a> can also be used to resolve
references in a dynamically loaded shared object. Symbols
may be placed in the dynamic symbol table either because the
executable was linked with the flag &quot;-rdynamic&quot;
(or, synonymously, &quot;--export-dynamic&quot;), which
causes all of the executable&rsquo;s global symbols to be
placed in the dynamic symbol table, or because <a href="https://man.page/1/ld">ld(1)</a>
noted a dependency on a symbol in another object during
static linking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the same
shared object is opened again with <b>dlopen</b>(), the same
object handle is returned. The dynamic linker maintains
reference counts for object handles, so a dynamically loaded
shared object is not deallocated until <b>dlclose</b>() has
been called on it as many times as <b>dlopen</b>() has
succeeded on it. Constructors (see below) are called only
when the object is actually loaded into memory (i.e., when
the reference count increases to 1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A subsequent
<b>dlopen</b>() call that loads the same shared object with
<b>RTLD_NOW</b> may force symbol resolution for a shared
object earlier loaded with <b>RTLD_LAZY</b>. Similarly, an
object that was previously opened with <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> can
be promoted to <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> in a subsequent
<b>dlopen</b>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>dlopen</b>() fails for any reason, it returns NULL.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dlmopen()</b>
<br>
This function performs the same task as
<b>dlopen</b>()&mdash;the <i>filename</i> and <i>flags</i>
arguments, as well as the return value, are the same, except
for the differences noted below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>dlmopen</b>() function differs from <b>dlopen</b>()
primarily in that it accepts an additional argument,
<i>lmid</i>, that specifies the link-map list (also referred
to as a <i>namespace</i>) in which the shared object should
be loaded. (By comparison, <b>dlopen</b>() adds the
dynamically loaded shared object to the same namespace as
the shared object from which the <b>dlopen</b>() call is
made.) The <i>Lmid_t</i> type is an opaque handle that
refers to a namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>lmid</i>
argument is either the ID of an existing namespace (which
can be obtained using the <a href="https://man.page/3/dlinfo">dlinfo(3)</a>
<b>RTLD_DI_LMID</b> request) or one of the following special
values: <b><br>
LM_ID_BASE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Load the shared object in the
initial namespace (i.e., the application&rsquo;s
namespace).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LM_ID_NEWLM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create a new namespace and load
the shared object in that namespace. The object must have
been correctly linked to reference all of the other shared
objects that it requires, since the new namespace is
initially empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>filename</i> is NULL, then the only permitted value for
<i>lmid</i> is <b>LM_ID_BASE</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dlclose()</b>
<br>
The function <b>dlclose</b>() decrements the reference count
on the dynamically loaded shared object referred to by
<i>handle</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
object&rsquo;s reference count drops to zero and no symbols
in this object are required by other objects, then the
object is unloaded after first calling any destructors
defined for the object. (Symbols in this object might be
required in another object because this object was opened
with the <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> flag and one of its symbols
satisfied a relocation in another object.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All shared
objects that were automatically loaded when <b>dlopen</b>()
was invoked on the object referred to by <i>handle</i> are
recursively closed in the same manner.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A successful
return from <b>dlclose</b>() does not guarantee that the
symbols associated with <i>handle</i> are removed from the
caller&rsquo;s address space. In addition to references
resulting from explicit <b>dlopen</b>() calls, a shared
object may have been implicitly loaded (and reference
counted) because of dependencies in other shared objects.
Only when all references have been released can the shared
object be removed from the address space.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On success,
<b>dlopen</b>() and <b>dlmopen</b>() return a non-NULL
handle for the loaded object. On error (file could not be
found, was not readable, had the wrong format, or caused
errors during loading), these functions return NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On success,
<b>dlclose</b>() returns 0; on error, it returns a nonzero
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Errors from
these functions can be diagnosed using

<h2>CONFORMING TO
<a name="CONFORMING TO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">POSIX.1-2001
describes <b>dlclose</b>() and <b>dlopen</b>(). The
<b>dlmopen</b>() function is a GNU extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>RTLD_NOLOAD</b>, <b>RTLD_NODELETE</b>, and
<b>RTLD_DEEPBIND</b> flags are GNU extensions; the first two
of these flags are also present on Solaris.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dlmopen()
and namespaces</b> <br>
A link-map list defines an isolated namespace for the
resolution of symbols by the dynamic linker. Within a
namespace, dependent shared objects are implicitly loaded
according to the usual rules, and symbol references are
likewise resolved according to the usual rules, but such
resolution is confined to the definitions provided by the
objects that have been (explicitly and implicitly) loaded
into the namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>dlmopen</b>() function permits object-load
isolation&mdash;the ability to load a shared object in a new
namespace without exposing the rest of the application to
the symbols made available by the new object. Note that the
use of the <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> flag is not sufficient for this
purpose, since it prevents a shared object&rsquo;s symbols
from being available to <i>any</i> other shared object. In
some cases, we may want to make the symbols provided by a
dynamically loaded shared object available to (a subset of)
other shared objects without exposing those symbols to the
entire application. This can be achieved by using a separate
namespace and the <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>dlmopen</b>() function also can be used to provide better
isolation than the <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> flag. In particular,
shared objects loaded with <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> may be promoted
to <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> if they are dependencies of another
shared object loaded with <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>. Thus,
<b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> is insufficient to isolate a loaded shared
object except in the (uncommon) case where one has explicit
control over all shared object dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Possible uses
of <b>dlmopen</b>() are plugins where the author of the
plugin-loading framework can&rsquo;t trust the plugin
authors and does not wish any undefined symbols from the
plugin framework to be resolved to plugin symbols. Another
use is to load the same object more than once. Without the
use of <b>dlmopen</b>(), this would require the creation of
distinct copies of the shared object file. Using
<b>dlmopen</b>(), this can be achieved by loading the same
shared object file into different namespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The glibc
implementation supports a maximum of 16 namespaces.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Initialization
and finalization functions</b> <br>
Shared objects may export functions using the
<b>__attribute__((constructor))</b> and
<b>__attribute__((destructor))</b> function attributes.
Constructor functions are executed before <b>dlopen</b>()
returns, and destructor functions are executed before
<b>dlclose</b>() returns. A shared object may export
multiple constructors and destructors, and priorities can be
associated with each function to determine the order in
which they are executed. See the <b>gcc</b> info pages
(under &quot;Function attributes&quot;) for further
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An older method
of (partially) achieving the same result is via the use of
two special symbols recognized by the linker: <b>_init</b>
and <b>_fini</b>. If a dynamically loaded shared object
exports a routine named <b>_init</b>(), then that code is
executed after loading a shared object, before
<b>dlopen</b>() returns. If the shared object exports a
routine named <b>_fini</b>(), then that routine is called
just before the object is unloaded. In this case, one must
avoid linking against the system startup files, which
contain default versions of these files; this can be done by
using the <a href="https://man.page/1/gcc">gcc(1)</a> <i>-nostartfiles</i> command-line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use of
<b>_init</b> and <b>_fini</b> is now deprecated in favor of
the aforementioned constructors and destructors, which among
other advantages, permit multiple initialization and
finalization functions to be defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since glibc
2.2.3, <a href="https://man.page/3/atexit">atexit(3)</a> can be used to register an exit
handler that is automatically called when a shared object is
unloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>History</b>
<br>
These functions are part of the dlopen API, derived from
SunOS.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As at glibc
2.24, specifying the <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> flag when calling
<b>dlmopen</b>() generates an error. Furthermore, specifying
<b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> when calling <b>dlopen</b>() results in a
program crash (<b>SIGSEGV</b>) if the call is made from any
object loaded in a namespace other than the initial
namespace.</p>
