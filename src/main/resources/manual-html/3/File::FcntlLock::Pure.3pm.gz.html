<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">File locking in
Perl is usually done using the &quot;flock&quot; function.
Unfortunately, this only allows locks on whole files and is
often implemented in terms of the <b>flock</b>(2) system
function which has some shortcomings (especially concerning
locks on remotely mounted file systems) and slightly
different behaviour than <b>fcntl</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using this
module file locking via <b>fcntl</b>(2) can be done
(obviously, this restricts the use of the module to systems
that have a <b>fcntl</b>(2) system call). Before a file (or
parts of a file) can be locked, an object simulating a flock
structure, containing information in a binary format to be
passed to <b>fcntl</b>(2) for locking requests, must be
created and its properties set. Afterwards, by calling the
<b>lock()</b> method a lock can be set and removed or it can
be determined if and which process currently holds the
lock.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">File::FcntlLock
(or its alias File::FcntlLock::XS) uses a shared library,
build during installation, to call the <b>fcntl</b>(2)
system function directly. If this is unsuitable there are
two alternatives, File::FcntlLock::Pure and
File::FcntlLock::Inline. Both call the Perl
&quot;fcntl&quot; function instead and use Perl code to
assemble and disassemble the structure. For this at some
time the (system-dependent) binary layout of the flock
structure must have been determined via a program written in
C. The difference between File::FcntlLock::Pure and
File::FcntlLock::Inline is that for the former this happened
when the package is installed while for the latter it is
done each time the package is loaded (e.g., with
&quot;use&quot;). Thus, for File::FcntlLock::Inline to work
a C compiler must be available. There are some minor
differences in the functionality and the behaviour on
passing the method for locking invalid arguments to be
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Creating
objects</b> <br>
&quot;new()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To create a new object,
representing a flock structure, call <b>new()</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$fs = new
File::FcntlLock;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The object has
a number of properties, reflecting the members of the flock
structure to be passed to <b>fcntl</b>(2) (see below). Per
default on object creation the l_type property is set to
&quot;F_RDLCK&quot;, l_whence to &quot;SEEK_SET&quot;, and
both l_start and l_len to 0, i.e., the settings for a read
lock on the whole file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These defaults
can be overruled by passing the <b>new()</b> method a set of
key-value pairs to initialize the objects properties, e.g.
use</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$fs = new
File::FcntlLock( l_type =&gt; F_WRLCK, <br>
l_whence =&gt; SEEK_SET, <br>
l_start =&gt; 0, <br>
l_len =&gt; 100 );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if you intend
to obtain a write lock for the first 100 bytes of a
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Object
properties</b> <br>
Once the object simulating the flock structure has been
created the following methods allow to query and, in most
cases, to also modify its properties. <br>
&quot;l_type()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If called without an argument
the method returns the current setting of the lock type,
otherwise the lock type is set to the argument&rsquo;s value
which must be either &quot;F_RDLCK&quot;,
&quot;F_WRLCK&quot; or &quot;F_UNLCK&quot; (for read lock,
write lock or unlock).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;l_whence()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This method sets, when called
with an argument, the l_whence property of the flock object,
determining if the l_start value is relative to the start of
the file, to the current position in the file or to the end
of the file. These values are &quot;SEEK_SET&quot;,
&quot;SEEK_CUR&quot; and &quot;SEEK_END&quot; (also see the
man page for <b>lseek</b>(2)). If called with no argument
the current value of the property is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;l_start()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Queries or sets the start
position (offset) of the lock in the file according to the
mode selected by the l_whence member. See also the man page
for <b>lseek</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;l_len()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Queries or sets the length of
the region (in bytes) in the file to be locked. A value of 0
is interpreted to mean a lock, starting at
&quot;l_start&quot;, to the end of the file. E.g., a lock
obtained with l_whence set to &quot;SEEK_SET&quot; and both
l_start and l_len set to 0 locks the complete file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">According to
SUSv3 support for negative values for l_len are permitted,
resulting in a lock ranging from &quot;l_start+l_len&quot;
up to and including &quot;l_start-1&quot;. But not all
systems support negative values for l_len and will return an
error when you try to obtain such a lock, so please read the
<b>fcntl</b>(2) man page of the system carefully for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;l_pid()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a call of the <b>lock()</b>
method with &quot;F_GETLK&quot; indicates that another
process is holding the lock (in which case the l_type
property will be either &quot;F_WRLCK&quot; or
&quot;F_RDLCK&quot;) a call of the <b>l_pid()</b> method
returns the <small>PID</small> of the process holding the
lock. This method does not accept any arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Locking</b>
<br>
After having set up the object representing a flock
structure one can then try to obtain a lock, release it or
determine the current holder of the lock by invoking the
<b>lock()</b> method: <br>
&quot;lock()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This method expects two
arguments. The first one is a file handle (or typeglob).
File::FcntlLock, and thus File::FcntlLock::XS (<b>but
neither</b> File::FcntlLock::Pure <b>nor</b>
File::FcntlLock::Inline), also accepts a &quot;raw&quot;
integer file descriptor. The second argument is a flag
indicating the action to be taken. So call it as in</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$fs-&gt;lock(
$fh, F_SETLK );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
values that can be used as the second argument: <br>
&quot;F_SETLK&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">With &quot;F_SETLK&quot; the
<b>lock()</b> method tries to obtain a lock (when l_type is
set to either &quot;F_WRLCK&quot; or &quot;F_RDLCK&quot;) or
releases it (if l_type is set to &quot;F_UNLCK&quot;). If an
attempt is made to obtain a lock but a lock is already being
held by some other process the method returns
&quot;undef&quot; and &quot;errno&quot; is set to
&quot;EACCESS&quot; or &quot;EAGAIN&quot; (please see the
the man page for <b>fcntl</b>(2) for more details).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;F_SETLKW&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">is similar to
&quot;F_SETLK&quot;, but instead of returning an error if
the lock can&rsquo;t be obtained immediately it puts the
calling process to sleep, i.e., it blocks, until the lock is
obtained at some later time. If a signal is received while
waiting for the lock the method returns &quot;undef&quot;
and &quot;errno&quot; is set to &quot;EINTR&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;F_GETLK&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">With &quot;F_GETLK&quot; the
<b>lock()</b> method determines if and which process
currently is holding the lock. If there&rsquo;s no other
lock the l_type property will be set to &quot;F_UNLCK&quot;.
Otherwise the flock structure object is set to the values
that would prevent us from obtaining a lock. There may be
several processes that keep us from getting a lock,
including some that themselves are blocked waiting to obtain
a lock. &quot;F_GETLK&quot; will only make details of one of
these processes visible, and one has no control over which
process this is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On success the
<b>lock()</b> method returns the string &quot;0 but
true&quot;, i.e., a value that is true in boolean but 0 in
numeric context. If the method fails (as indicated by an
&quot;undef&quot; return value) you can either immediately
evaluate the error number (using $!, $ERRNO or $OS_ERROR) or
check for it via the methods discussed below at some later
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Error
handling</b> <br>
There are minor differences between File::FcntlLock on the
one hand and File::FcntlLock::Pure and
File::FcntlLock::Inline on the other, due to the first
calling the system function <b>fcntl</b>(2) directly while
the latter two invoke the Perl &quot;fcntl&quot; function.
Perl&rsquo;s &quot;fcntl&quot; function already returns a
Perl error on some types of invalid arguments. In contrast
File::FcntlLock passes them on to the <b>fcntl</b>(2) system
call and then returns the systems response to the
caller.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
methods for obtaining information about the reason the a
call of the <b>lock()</b> method failed: <br>
&quot;lock_errno()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns the &quot;errno&quot;
error number from the latest call of <b>lock()</b>. If the
last call did not result in an error &quot;undef&quot; is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;error()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns a short description of
the error that happened during the latest call of
<b>lock()</b>. Please take the messages with a grain of
salt, they represent what SUSv3 ( <small>IEEE
1003.1-2001</small> ) and the Linux, <small>TRUE64,</small>
OpenBSD3 and Solaris8 man pages tell what the error numbers
mean. There could be differences (and additional error
numbers) on other systems. If there was no error the method
returns &quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;system_error()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">While the <b>error()</b> method
tries to return a string with some direct relevance to the
locking operation (i.e., &quot;File or segment already
locked by other process(es)&quot; instead of
&quot;Permission denied&quot;) this method returns the
&quot;normal&quot; system error message associated with
&quot;errno&quot;. The method returns &quot;undef&quot; if
there was no error.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>EXPORT</small></b>
<br>
The package exports the following constants: <br>
F_GETLK F_SETLK F_SETLKW <br>
F_RDLCK F_WRLCK F_UNLCK <small><br>
SEEK_SET SEEK_CUR SEEK_END</small></p>

<h2>INCOMPATIBILITIES
<a name="INCOMPATIBILITIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Obviously, this
module requires that there&rsquo;s a <b>fcntl</b>(2) system
call. Note also that under certain circumstances the
File::FcntlLock::Pure and File::FcntlLock::Inline modules
may not have been installed. This happens on 32-bit systems
that use 64-bit integers in their flock structure but where
the installed Perl version doesn&rsquo;t support the
&rsquo;q&rsquo; format for its &quot;pack&quot; and
&quot;unpack&quot; functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thanks to Mark
Jason Dominus and Benjamin Goldberg for helpful discussions,
code examples and encouragement. Glenn Herteg pointed out
several problems and also helped improve the documentation.
Julian Moreno Patino helped correcting the documentation and
pointed out problems arising on <small>GNU</small> Hurd
which seems to have only very rudimentary support for
locking with <b>fcntl</b>(2). Niko Tyni and Guillem Jover
encouraged and helped with implementing alternatives to an
XS-only approach which hopefully will make the module more
useful under certain circumstances.</p>
