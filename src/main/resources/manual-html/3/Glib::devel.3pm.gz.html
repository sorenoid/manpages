<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Glib::devel -
Binding developer&rsquo;s overview of Glib&rsquo;s
internals</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Do you need to
know how the gtk2-perl language bindings work, or need to
write your own language bindings for a Glib/Gtk2-based
library? Then you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. If you
are just a perl developer wanting to write programs with
Glib or Gtk2, then this is probably way over your head.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
began its life as a post to gtk-perl-list about a redesign
of the fundamentals of the bindings; today it is the
reference documentation for the developers of the
bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To reduce
confusion, refer to GLib, the C library, with a capital L,
and Glib the perl module with a lower-case l. While the Gtk2
module is the primary client of Glib, it is not necessarily
the only one; in fact, the perl bindings for the GStreamer
library build directly atop Glib. Therefore, this document
describes just the GLib/Glib basics. For details on how Gtk2
extends upon the concepts presented here, see
Gtk2::devel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In various
places, we use the name GPerl to refer to the actual binding
subsystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
avoid getting very quickly out of date, this document
doesn&rsquo;t go into great detail on APIs. gperl.h is
rather heavily commented, and should be considered the
canonical source of correct <small>API</small>
information.</p>

<h2>Basic Philosophy
<a name="Basic Philosophy"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GLib is a
portability library for C programs, providing a common set
of APIs and services on various platforms. Along with that
you get libgobject, which provides an inheritance-based type
system and other spiffy things.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Glib, as a perl
module, must decide which portions of GLib&rsquo;s
facilities to map to perl and which to abstract and
encapsulate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the grand
scheme, the bindings have been designed with a few basic
tenets in mind:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>-</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Stick close to the C <small>API,</small> to allow a perl
developer to use knowledge from the C <small>API</small> and
<small>API</small> reference docs with the perl bindings;
this is overruled in some places by the remaining
tenets.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>-</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Be perlish. This is the most important. The user of the
perl bindings should not have to worry about memory
management, reference counting, freeing objects, and all
that stuff, else he might as well go write in C instead.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>-</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Leave out deprecated functionality.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>-</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Don&rsquo;t add new functionality. The exceptions to
this rule are consolidation of methods where default
parameters may be used, or where the direct analog from C is
not practical.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>-</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Be lightweight. As little indirection and bloat as
possible. If possible, implement each toplevel module (e.g.,
Glib, Gtk2, Gnome2, GtkHTML, etc) as one .pm and one
.so.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>-</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Be extensible. Export header files and typemaps so that
other modules can easily chain off of our base. Do not
require the entirely of Gtk2 for someone who needs only to
build atop GObject.</p></td></tr>

<h2>The Glib Module
<a name="The Glib Module"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In keeping with
the tenet of not requiring the entire car for someone who
only needs a single wheel, I broke the glib/gobject library
family into its own module and namespace. This has proved to
be a godsend, as it has made things very easy to debug;
there&rsquo;s a clean separation between the base of the
type system and the stuff on top of it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Glib module
takes care of all the basic types handled by the GObject
library --- GEnum, GFlags, GBoxed, GObject, GValue, GClosure
--- as well has signal marshalling and such in GSignal.
I&rsquo;ll discuss each of these separately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In practice,
you will rarely see direct calls to the functions that
convert objects in and out of perl. Most code should use the
C preprocessor to provide easier-to-remember names that
follow the perl <small>API</small> style, e.g.,
newSVGObject(obj) rather than gperl_new_object(type,obj) and
SvGObject(sv) instead of gperl_get_gobject(type, sv). The
convention used in all of gtk2-perl is described in
Gtk2::devel.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Wrappers</b>
<small><br>
FIXME</small> maybe this section should be rolled into the
GBoxed and GObject sections?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to use
the C data structures from Perl, we need to wrap those
objects up in Perl objects. In general, a Perl object is
simply a blessed reference. A typical scheme for
representing C objects in perl is bless a reference to a
scalar holding the C pointer value; perl will destroy the
reference-counted scalar when there are no more references
to it, and one would normally destroy the underlying data
structure at this point. However, GLib is a little more
complex than your typical C library, so this easy, typical
setup won&rsquo;t work for us.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GBoxed types
are opaque wrappers for C structures, providing copy and
free functions, to allow the types to be used generically.
For the most part we can get away with using the typical
scheme described above to provide an opaque object, but in
some instances an opaque object is very alien in perl. The
Glib::Boxed section explains how we get around this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GObject, on the
other hand, is a type-aware, reference-counted object with
lifetime semantics that differ somewhat from perl SVs. Thus
we need something a bit more sophisticated than a plain old
opaque wrapper; in fact, we use a blessed hash reference
with the pointer to the C object tucked away in attached
magic, and a pointer to the <small>SV</small> stored in the
GObject&rsquo;s user data. The combined perl/C object does
some nifty reference-count borrowing to ensure that object
lifetime is managed correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an object is
created by a function that returns directly to perl, then
the wrapper returned by that function should &quot;own&quot;
the object. If no other code assumes ownership of that
object (by ref&rsquo;ing a GObject or copying a GBoxed),
then the object should be destroyed when the perl scalar is
destroyed (actually, as part of its destruction).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a function
returns a preexisting object owned by someone else, then the
bindings should <small>NOT</small> destroy the object with
the perl wrapper. How we handle this for the various types
is described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GType to
Package Mappings</b> <br>
GType is the GObject library&rsquo;s unique type identifier;
this is a runtime variable, because GLib types may be loaded
dynamically. The direct analog in perl is the package name,
which uniquely specifies an object&rsquo;s class. Since
these do about the same thing, we completely replace the
GType with the perl package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For various
reasons, mostly to do with robustness and performance, there
is a one-to-one mapping between GType classes and perl
package names. These must be registered, usually as part of
the module initialization process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
the type system tries as hard as it can to recover when
things don&rsquo;t go well, using the GType system to its
advantage. If you return a C object of a type that is not
registered with Gperl, such as MyCustomTypeFoo,
gperl_new_object (see below) will warn you that it has
blessed the unknown MyCustomTypeFoo into the first known
package in its ancestry, Gtk2::VBox.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GBoxed and
GObject have distinct mapping registries to avoid
cross-pollination and mistakes in the type system. See
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To assist in
handling inheritance that isn&rsquo;t specified directly by
the GType system, the function gperl_set_isa allows you to
add elements to the @ISA for a package.
gperl_register_object does this for you, but you may need to
add additional parents, e.g., for implementing GInterfaces.
(see Gtk2/xs/GtkEntry.xs for an example)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may be
thinking that we could use substitution rules to map the
GObject classes to perl packages. In practice, this is a bad
idea, fraught with problems; the substitution rules are not
easily extendable and are easily broken by extension
packages which don&rsquo;t follow the naming
conventions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GEnums and
GFlags</b> <br>
GLib provides a mechanism for creating runtime type
information about enumeration and flag types. Enumerations
are lists of specific values, one of which may be used at at
time, whereas multiple flag values may be supplied at a
time. In C flags are meant to be used with bitfields. A
GType is associated with the various valid values for a
given GEnum or GFlags type as strings, in both full-name and
nickname forms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GPerl uses this
mechanism to avoid the need to know integer values for enum
and flag types at the perl level. An enum value is just a
string; a bitfield of flag values is represented as a
reference to an array of strings. These strings are the
GLib-provided nicknames. For the convenience of a perl
developer, the bindings treat &rsquo;-&rsquo; and
&rsquo;_&rsquo; as equivalent when looking up the
corresponding integer values during conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A GEnum or
GFlags type mapping should be registered with</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">void
gperl_register_fundamental (GType gtype, const char *
package);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">so that their
package names can be used where a GType is required (for
example, as GObject property types or GtkTreeModel column
types).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
functions for converting between C and perl values are</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/* croak if val
is not part of type, otherwise return <br>
* corresponding value. this is the general case. */ <br>
gint gperl_convert_enum (GType type, SV * val); <br>
/* return a scalar which is the nickname of the enum value
<br>
* val, or croak if val is not a member of the enum. */ <br>
SV * gperl_convert_back_enum (GType type, gint val); <br>
/* collapse a list of strings to an integer with all the
<br>
* correct bits set, croak if anything is invalid. */ <br>
gint gperl_convert_flags (GType type, SV * val); <br>
/* convert a bitfield to a list of strings, or croak. */
<br>
SV * gperl_convert_back_flags (GType type, gint val);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other utility
functions allow for finer-grained control, such as the
ability to pass unknown values, which can be necessary in
special cases. In general, each of these functions raises an
exception when something goes wrong. To be helpful, they
croak with a message listing the valid values when they
encounter invalid input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GBoxed</b>
<br>
GBoxed provides a way to register functions that create,
copy, and destroy opaque structures. For our purposes,
we&rsquo;ll allow any perl package to inherit from
Glib::Boxed and implement accessors for the struct members,
but Glib::Boxed will handle the object and wrapper lifetime
issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
functions for creating boxed wrappers:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SV *
gperl_new_boxed (gpointer boxed, GType gtype, gboolean own);
<br>
SV * gperl_new_boxed_copy (gpointer boxed, GType gtype);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If own is
<small>TRUE,</small> the wrapper returned by gperl_new_boxed
will take boxed with it when it dies. In the case of a copy,
own is implied, so there&rsquo;s a separate function which
doesn&rsquo;t need the own option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To get a boxed
pointer out of a scalar wrapper, you just call
gperl_get_boxed_check --- this will croak if the sv is undef
or not blessed into the specified package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
register a boxed type you get the option of supplying a
table of function pointers describing how the boxed object
should be wrapped, unwrapped, and destroyed. This allows you
to decide in the wrapping function what subclass of the
boxed type&rsquo;s class the wrapper should actually take (a
trick used by Gtk2::Gdk::Event), or represent a boxed type
as a native perl type (such as using array references for
Gnome2::Canvas::Point objects). All of this happens
automagically, behind the scenes, and most types assume the
default wrapper class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the
commentary in gperl.h for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GObject</b>
<br>
The GObject knows its own type. Thus, we need only one
parameter to create a GObject wrapper. In reality, we ask
for two:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SV *
gperl_new_object (GObject * object, gboolean own);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The wrapper
<small>SV</small> will be blessed into the package
corresponding to the gtype returned by G_OBJECT_TYPE
(object), that is, the bottommost type in the inheritance
chain. If that bottommost type is not known, the function
walks back up the tree until it finds one that&rsquo;s
known, blesses the reference into that package, and spits
out a warning on stderr. To hush the warning, you need
merely call</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
this process will claim a reference on the GObject (with
<b>g_object_ref()</b>), so that the C object stays alive so
long as there is a perl wrapper for it. If
&lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; is set to <small>TRUE,</small> the
perl wrapper will claim ownership of the C object by
removing that reference; in theory, for a new GObject, fresh
from a constructor, this leaves the object with a single
reference owned by the perl object. The next question out of
your mouth should be, &quot;But what about GObject
derivatives that require sinking or other strange methods to
claim ownership?&quot; For the answer, see the GtkObject
section&rsquo;s description of sink functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">void
gperl_register_object (GType gtype, const char *
package);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This magical
function also sets up the @ISA for the package to point to
the package corresponding to g_type_parent (gtype). [Since
this requires the parent package to be registered, there is
a simple deferral mechanism, which means your @ISA might not
be set until the next call to gperl_register_object.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
ways to get an object out of an <small>SV</small> (though I
think only one is really needed):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GObject *
gperl_get_object (SV * sv); <br>
GObject * gperl_get_object_check (SV * sv, GType gtype);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second one
is like the first, but croaks if the object is not derived
from gtype.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can get and
set object data and object parameters just like you&rsquo;d
expect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GSignal</b>
<br>
All of this GObject stuff wouldn&rsquo;t be very useful if
you couldn&rsquo;t connect signals and closures. I got most
of my handling code from gtk2-perl and pygtk, and it&rsquo;s
pretty straightforward. The data member is optional, and
must be a scalar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To connect perl
subroutines to GSignals I use GClosures, which require the
handling of GValues.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GPerlClosure</b>
<br>
Use a GPerlClosure wherever you could use a GClosure and
things should work out great. <i><small>FIXME</small> say
more here</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GPerlCallback</b>
<br>
Function pointers are required in many places throughout
gtk+, usually for a callback to be used as a
&quot;foreach&quot; function or for some other purpose.
Unfortunately, a majority of these spots aren&rsquo;t
designed to work with GClosures (usually by lacking a way to
destroy data associated with the callback when it is no
longer needed). For this purpose, the GPerlCallback wraps up
the gruntwork of using perl&rsquo;s call_sv to use a
callback function directly.</p>
