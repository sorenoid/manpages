{"name":"pam","description":"PAM, pam -\nPluggable Authentication Modules for Linux\n\n<h2>DESCRIPTION\n<a name=\"DESCRIPTION\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\nThis manual is\nintended to offer a quick introduction to <b>Linux-PAM</b>.\nFor more information the reader is directed to the\n<b>Linux-PAM system administrators' guide</b>.\n\n\n<b>Linux-PAM</b>\nis a system of libraries that handle the authentication\ntasks of applications (services) on the system. The library\nprovides a stable general interface (Application Programming\nInterface - API) that privilege granting programs (such as\n<a href=\"https://man.page/1/login\">login(1)</a> and <a href=\"https://man.page/1/su\">su(1)</a>) defer to to perform\nstandard authentication tasks.\n\nThe principal\nfeature of the PAM approach is that the nature of the\nauthentication is dynamically configurable. In other words,\nthe system administrator is free to choose how individual\nservice-providing applications will authenticate users. This\ndynamic configuration is set by the contents of the single\n<b>Linux-PAM</b> configuration file /etc/pam.conf.\nAlternatively, the configuration can be set by individual\nconfiguration files located in the /etc/pam.d/ directory.\nThe presence of this directory will cause <b>Linux-PAM</b>\nto <i>ignore</i> /etc/pam.conf.\n\n\nVendor-supplied\nPAM configuration files might be installed in the system\ndirectory /usr/lib/pam.d/ or a configurable vendor specific\ndirectory instead of the machine configuration directory\n/etc/pam.d/. If no machine configuration file is found, the\nvendor-supplied file is used. All files in /etc/pam.d/\noverride files with the same name in other directories.\n\nFrom the point\nof view of the system administrator, for whom this manual is\nprovided, it is not of primary importance to understand the\ninternal behavior of the <b>Linux-PAM</b> library. The\nimportant point to recognize is that the configuration\nfile(s) <i>define</i> the connection between applications\n(<b>services</b>) and the pluggable authentication modules\n(<b>PAM</b>s) that perform the actual authentication\ntasks.\n\n\n<b>Linux-PAM</b>\nseparates the tasks of <i>authentication</i> into four\nindependent management groups: <b>account</b> management;\n<b>auth</b>entication management; <b>password</b>\nmanagement; and <b>session</b> management. (We highlight the\nabbreviations used for these groups in the configuration\nfile.)\n\nSimply put,\nthese groups take care of different aspects of a typical\nuser's request for a restricted service:\n\n<b>account</b>\n- provide account verification types of service: has the\nuser's password expired?; is this user permitted access to\nthe requested service?\n\n\n<b>auth</b>entication\n- authenticate a user and set up user credentials. Typically\nthis is via some challenge-response request that the user\nmust satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter\nyour password. Not all authentications are of this type,\nthere exist hardware based authentication schemes (such as\nthe use of smart-cards and biometric devices), with suitable\nmodules, these may be substituted seamlessly for more\nstandard approaches to authentication - such is the\nflexibility of <b>Linux-PAM</b>.\n\n\n<b>password</b>\n- this group's responsibility is the task of updating\nauthentication mechanisms. Typically, such services are\nstrongly coupled to those of the <b>auth</b> group. Some\nauthentication mechanisms lend themselves well to being\nupdated with such a function. Standard UN*X password-based\naccess is the obvious example: please enter a replacement\npassword.\n\n<b>session</b>\n- this group of tasks cover things that should be done prior\nto a service being given and after it is withdrawn. Such\ntasks include the maintenance of audit trails and the\nmounting of the user's home directory. The <b>session</b>\nmanagement group is important as it provides both an opening\nand closing hook for modules to affect the services\navailable to a user.\n\n<h2>FILES\n<a name=\"FILES\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n/etc/pam.conf\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:17%;\">the configuration file\n\n/etc/pam.d\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:17%;\">the <b>Linux-PAM</b>\nconfiguration directory.
