Because of some history\n(see below), use of the term &quot;libc&quot; to refer to\nthe standard C library is somewhat ambiguous on Linux.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\"><b>glibc</b>\n<br>\nBy far the most widely used C library on Linux is the GNU C\nLibrary\n<a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/\">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/</a>,\noften referred to as <i>glibc</i>. This is the C library\nthat is nowadays used in all major Linux distributions. It\nis also the C library whose details are documented in the\nrelevant pages of the <i>man-pages</i> project (primarily in\nSection 3 of the manual). Documentation of glibc is also\navailable in the glibc manual, available via the command\n<i>info libc</i>. Release 1.0 of glibc was made in September\n1992. (There were earlier 0.x releases.) The next major\nrelease of glibc was 2.0, at the beginning of 1997.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">The pathname\n<i>/lib/libc.so.6</i> (or something similar) is normally a\nsymbolic link that points to the location of the glibc\nlibrary, and executing this pathname will cause glibc to\ndisplay various information about the version installed on\nyour system.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\"><b>Linux\nlibc</b> <br>\nIn the early to mid 1990s, there was for a while <i>Linux\nlibc</i>, a fork of glibc 1.x created by Linux developers\nwho felt that glibc development at the time was not\nsufficing for the needs of Linux. Often, this library was\nreferred to (ambiguously) as just &quot;libc&quot;. Linux\nlibc released major versions 2, 3, 4, and 5, as well as many\nminor versions of those releases. Linux libc4 was the last\nversion to use the a.out binary format, and the first\nversion to provide (primitive) shared library support. Linux\nlibc 5 was the first version to support the ELF binary\nformat; this version used the shared library soname\n<i>libc.so.5</i>. For a while, Linux libc was the standard C\nlibrary in many Linux distributions.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">However,\nnotwithstanding the original motivations of the Linux libc\neffort, by the time glibc 2.0 was released (in 1997), it was\nclearly superior to Linux libc, and all major Linux\ndistributions that had been using Linux libc soon switched\nback to glibc. To avoid any confusion with Linux libc\nversions, glibc 2.0 and later used the shared library soname\n<i>libc.so.6</i>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Since the\nswitch from Linux libc to glibc 2.0 occurred long ago,\n<i>man-pages</i> no longer takes care to document Linux libc\ndetails. Nevertheless, the history is visible in vestiges of\ninformation about Linux libc that remain in a few manual\npages, in particular, references to <i>libc4</i> and\n<i>libc5</i>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\"><b>Other C\nlibraries</b> <br>\nThere are various other less widely used C libraries for\nLinux. These libraries are generally smaller than glibc,\nboth in terms of features and memory footprint, and often\nintended for building small binaries, perhaps targeted at\ndevelopment for embedded Linux systems. Among such libraries\nare <a href=\"http://www.uclibc.org/\"><i>uClibc</i></a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/\"><i>dietlibc</i></a>,\nand <a href=\"http://www.musl-libc.org/\"><i>musl\nlibc</i></a>. Details of these libraries are covered by the\n<i>man-pages</i> project, where they are known.</p>\n\n<h2>SEE ALSO\n<a name=\"SEE ALSO\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\"><a href=\"https://man.page/2/syscalls\">syscalls(2)</a>,\n<a href=\"https://man.page/3/getauxval\">getauxval(3)</a>, <a href=\"https://man.page/5/proc\">proc(5)</a>,\n<a href=\"https://man.page/7/feature_test_macros\">feature_test_macros(7)</a>, <a href=\"https://man.page/7/man-pages\">man-pages(7)</a>,\n<a href=\"https://man.page/7/standards\">standards(7)</a>, <a href=\"https://man.page/7/vdso\">vdso(7)</a></p>\n\n<h2>COLOPHON\n<a name=\"COLOPHON\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">This page is\npart of release 5.10 of the Linux <i>man-pages</i> project.\nA description of the project, information about reporting\nbugs, and the latest version of this page, can be found at\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/.</p>\n<hr>\n","headings":["<a href=\"#NAME\">NAME</a>","<a href=\"#DESCRIPTION\">DESCRIPTION</a>","<a href=\"#SEE ALSO\">SEE ALSO</a>","<a href=\"#COLOPHON\">COLOPHON</a>"],"level":7}
