By contrast, the GNU General\nPublic <br>\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\nchange free <br>\nsoftware---to make sure the software is free for all its\nusers. This <br>\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n<br>\nFoundation&rsquo;s software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to <br>\nusing it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by <br>\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can\napply it to <br>\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak\nof free software, we are referring to freedom, not <br>\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\nthat you <br>\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and\ncharge for <br>\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or\ncan get it <br>\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use\npieces of it <br>\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these\nthings.\n\nTo protect your\nrights, we need to make restrictions that forbid <br>\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\nthe rights. <br>\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you <br>\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if\nyou distribute copies of such a program, whether <br>\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the\nrights that <br>\nyou have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can\nget the <br>\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know\ntheir <br>\nrights.\n\nWe protect your\nrights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and <br>\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission\nto copy, <br>\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each\nauthor&rsquo;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\n<br>\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this\nfree <br>\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and\npassed on, we <br>\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the\noriginal, so <br>\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\nthe original <br>\nauthors&rsquo; reputations.\n\nFinally, any\nfree program is threatened constantly by software <br>\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of\na free <br>\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect\nmaking the <br>\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\nthat any <br>\npatent must be licensed for everyone&rsquo;s free use or not\nlicensed at all.\n\nThe precise\nterms and conditions for copying, distribution and <br>\nmodification follow.\n\n\n<b><small>TERMS\nAND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING</small> , <small>DISTRIBUTION AND\nMODIFICATION</small></b>\n\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" frame=\"void\"\n       cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tr valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">\n<td width=\"11%\"></td>\n<td width=\"3%\">\n\n\n<p>0.</td>\n<td width=\"3%\"></td>\n<td width=\"83%\">\n\n\n<p>This License applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it\nmay be distributed under the terms of this General Public\nLicense.
