It was formed in 2004 as the successor\nto the X.Org Group at The Open Group. The purpose of the\nX.Org Foundation is to foster the development, evolution,\nand maintenance of the X Window System, a comprehensive set\nof vendor-neutral, system-architecture neutral,\nnetwork-transparent windowing and user interface standards.\nMembership in the X.Org Foundation is free and open to\nanyone. The X.Org Foundation hosts a public git repository\nof the source code on freedesktop.org.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">The X Window\nSystem was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology. In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded\nconsortium to provide the technical and administrative\nleadership necessary to support further development of the X\nWindow System. In 1992, MIT and the membership decided it\nwas in their best interests to move the consortium out of\nMIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization. All\nrights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X\nConsortium, Inc. on January 1, 1994. On December 31, 1996\nthe X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors and all rights to\nthe X Window System were assigned to The Open Group (then\nknown as the Open Software Foundation).</p>\n\n<h2>ADDRESSES\n<a name=\"ADDRESSES\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">The X.Org\nFoundation&rsquo;s web site is http://www.x.org/</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">The X.Org\nFoundation&rsquo;s public ftp site is ftp://ftp.x.org/</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Information\nabout the X.Org Foundation git repository is on the X.Org\nweb site at http://www.x.org/wiki/Development/git</p>\n<hr>\n","headings":["<a href=\"#NAME\">NAME</a>","<a href=\"#SYNOPSIS\">SYNOPSIS</a>","<a href=\"#DESCRIPTION\">DESCRIPTION</a>","<a href=\"#ADDRESSES\">ADDRESSES</a>"],"level":7}
