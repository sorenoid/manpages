The most effective approach known is to\nencourage commercial redistributors to donate.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Users of free\nsoftware systems can boost the pace of development by\nencouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their\nselling price to free software developers---the Free\nSoftware Foundation, and others.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">The way to\nconvince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect\nit from them. So when you compare distributors, judge them\npartly by how much they give to free software development.\nShow distributors they must compete to be the one who gives\nthe most.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">To make this\napproach work, you must insist on numbers that you can\ncompare, such as, &rsquo;&rsquo;We will donate ten dollars\nto the Frobnitz project for each disk sold.&rsquo;&rsquo;\nDon&rsquo;t be satisfied with a vague promise, such as\n&rsquo;&rsquo;A portion of the profits are\ndonated,&rsquo;&rsquo; since it doesn&rsquo;t give a basis\nfor comparison.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Even a precise\nfraction &rsquo;&rsquo;of the profits from this\ndisk&rsquo;&rsquo; is not very meaningful, since creative\naccounting and unrelated business decisions can greatly\nalter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit. If\nthe price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is\nprobably less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or\nnothing at all.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Some\nredistributors do development work themselves. This is\nuseful too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire\nhow much they do, and what kind. Some kinds of development\nmake much more long-term difference than others. For\nexample, maintaining a separate version of a program\ncontributes very little; maintaining the standard version of\na program for the whole community contributes much. Easy new\nports contribute little, since someone else would surely do\nthem; difficult ports such as adding a new\n<small>CPU</small> to the <small>GNU</small> Compiler\nCollection contribute more; major new features or packages\ncontribute the most.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">By establishing\nthe idea that supporting further development is\n&rsquo;&rsquo;the proper thing to do&rsquo;&rsquo; when\ndistributing free software for a fee, we can assure a steady\nflow of resources into making more free software.</p>\n\n<h2>SEE ALSO\n<a name=\"SEE ALSO\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\"><i>gpl</i>(7),\n<i>gfdl</i>(7).</p>\n\n<h2>COPYRIGHT\n<a name=\"COPYRIGHT\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Copyright (c)\n1994 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
