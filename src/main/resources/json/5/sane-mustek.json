{"name":"sane-mustek","description":"sane-mustek -\nSANE backend for Mustek SCSI flatbed scanners (and some\nother devices)\n\n<h2>DESCRIPTION\n<a name=\"DESCRIPTION\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\nThe\n<b>sane-mustek</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access\nNow Easy) backend that provides access to Mustek (and some\nrelabeled Trust and Primax) SCSI and parport flatbed\nscanners. At present, the following scanners are known to\nwork more or less with this backend:\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em\">Paragon\nMFS-6000CX <br>\nParagon MFS-12000CX <br>\nParagon MFC-600S, 600 II CD, ScanMagic 600 II SP <br>\nParagon MFC-800S, 800 II SP <br>\nParagon MFS-6000SP <br>\nParagon MFS-8000SP <br>\nParagon MFS-1200SP, MFS-12000SP <br>\nScanExpress 6000SP <br>\nScanExpress 12000SP, 12000SP Plus, Paragon 1200 III SP,\nScanMagic 9636S, 9636S Plus <br>\nParagon 1200 LS <br>\nScanExpress A3 SP <br>\nParagon 1200 SP Pro <br>\nParagon 1200 A3 Pro <br>\nParagon 600 II EP <br>\nParagon 600 II N <br>\nTrust Imagery 1200 <br>\nTrust Imagery 1200 SP <br>\nTrust Imagery 4800 SP <br>\nTrust SCSI Connect 19200 <br>\nPrimax Compact 4800 SCSI\n\nMore details\ncan be found on the Mustek SCSI backend homepage\n<i>http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek-backend/</i>.\n\nDon&rsquo;t mix\nup MFS (Paragon), Pro and ScanExpress models! They&rsquo;re\ncompletely different. Check the exact model name!\n\nNote that most\nof the above scanners come with a SCSI interface. The only\nnon-SCSI scanners that have some support at this point is\nthe 600 II N and 600 II EP scanners. The former one comes\nwith its own parallel port adapter (i.e., it does <i>not</i>\nattach to the printer port). Both scanners use the SCSI\nprotocol internally, too. More info on how to use these\nparallel port scanners can be found below in section\n<b>PARALLEL PORT SCANNERS</b>. Other parallel port scanners\nare not supported by this backend but you may be successful\nusing the Mustek parallel port backend mustek_pp, see\n<a href=\"https://man.page/5/sane-mustek_pp\">sane-mustek_pp(5)</a>. USB scanners are also not\nsupported by this backend but the ma1509, mustek_usb,\ngt68xx, and plustek backends include support for some of\nthem, see <a href=\"https://man.page/5/sane-ma1509\">sane-ma1509(5)</a>, <a href=\"https://man.page/5/sane-mustek_usb\">sane-mustek_usb(5)</a>,\n<a href=\"https://man.page/5/sane-gt68xx\">sane-gt68xx(5)</a>, and <a href=\"https://man.page/5/sane-plustek\">sane-plustek(5)</a>.\n\nMustek scanners\nhave no protection against exceeding the physical scan area\nheight. That is, if a scan is attempted with a height that\nexceeds the height of the scan surface, the scanner begins\nmaking loud noises and the scan mechanism may be damaged.\nThus, if you hear such a noise, IMMEDIATELY turn off the\nscanner. This shouldn&rsquo;t happen if your scanner is in\nthe list of known scanners. There is more information in the\n<i>/usr/share/doc/libsane/PROBLEMS</i> file.\n\nIf you own a\nMustek (or Trust) scanner other than the ones listed above\nthat works with this backend, please let us know by sending\nthe scanner&rsquo;s exact model name (look at the front and\nback of the scanner) and a debug output to\n<i>sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net</i>. You can get the\ndebug output by setting the environment variable\n<b>SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK</b> to 5 and showing the list of\navailable scanners with <i>scanimage -L</i>. Please send all\nof it to the mailing list. You must be subscribed to\nsane-devel before you can send mail to the list. See\n<i>http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</i> for\ndetails.\n\n<h2>DEVICE NAMES\n<a name=\"DEVICE NAMES\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\nThis backend\nexpects device names of the form:\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em\"><i>special</i>\n\nWhere\n<i>special</i> is either the path-name for the special\ndevice that corresponds to a SCSI scanner or the port number\nat which the parallel port scanners can be found (see\nsection <b>PARALLEL PORT SCANNERS</b> below). For SCSI\nscanners, the special device name must be a generic SCSI\ndevice or a symlink to such a device. The program\n<a href=\"https://man.page/1/sane-find-scanner\">sane-find-scanner(1)</a> helps to find out the correct\ndevice. Under Linux, such a device name could be\n<i>/dev/sg0</i> or <i>/dev/sg3</i>, for example. See\n<a href=\"https://man.page/5/sane-scsi\">sane-scsi(5)</a> for details.\n\n<h2>CONFIGURATION\n<a name=\"CONFIGURATION\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\nThe contents of\nthe <i>mustek.conf</i> file is a list of options and device\nnames that correspond to Mustek scanners. Empty lines and\nlines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. See\n<a href=\"https://man.page/5/sane-scsi\">sane-scsi(5)</a> on details of what constitutes a valid\ndevice name.\n\nThe supported\noptions are <b>linedistance-fix</b>, <b>lineart-fix</b>,\n<b>legal-size</b>, <b>buffersize</b>, <b>blocksize</b>,\n<b>strip-height</b>, <b>disable-double-buffering</b>,\n<b>disable-backtracking</b>, and <b>force-wait</b>.\n\nOptions come in\ntwo flavors: global and positional ones. Global options\napply to all devices managed by the backend whereas\npositional options apply just to the most recently mentioned\ndevice. Note that this means that the order in which the\noptions appear matters!\n\nOption\n<b>linedistance-fix</b> is positional and works around a\nproblem that occurs with some SCSI controllers (notably the\nncr810 controller under Linux). If color scans have\nhorizontal stripes and/or the colors are off, then\nit&rsquo;s likely that your controller suffers from this\nproblem. Turning on this option usually fixes the\nproblem.\n\nOption\n<b>lineart-fix</b> is positional and works around a timing\nproblem that seems to exist with certain MFS-12000SP\nscanners. The problem manifests itself in dropped lines when\nscanning in lineart mode. Turning on this option should fix\nthe problem but may slow down scanning a bit.\n\nOption\n<b>legal-size</b> is positional and sets the size of the\nscan area to Legal format. Set this option if you own a\nParagon 12000 LS. It can&rsquo;t be distinguished by\nsoftware from a ScanExpress 12000 SP (ISO A4 format).\n\nOption\n<b>buffersize</b> is a positional option that overrides the\ndefault value set for the size of the SCSI buffer. The\nbuffer size is specified in kilobytes. The default value is\n128. Because of double buffering the buffer actually sent to\nthe scanner is half the size of this value. Try to increase\nthis value to achieve higher scan speeds. Note that some\nScanExpress scanners don&rsquo;t like buffer sizes above 64\nkb (buffersize = 128). If your sg driver can&rsquo;t set\nSCSI buffer sizes at runtime you may have to change that\nvalue, too. See sane-scsi(5) for details.\n\nOption\n<b>blocksize</b> is a positional option that overrides the\ndefault value set for the maximum amount of data scanned in\none block. The buffer size is specified in kilobytes. Some\nscanners freeze if this value is bigger than 2048. The\ndefault value is 1 GB (so effectively no limit) for most\nscanners. Don&rsquo;t change this value if you don&rsquo;t\nknow exactly what you do.\n\nOption\n<b>strip-height</b> is a global option that limits the\nmaximum height of the strip scanned with a single SCSI read\ncommand. The height is specified in inches and may contain a\nfractional part (e.g., 1.5). Setting the strip-height to a\nsmall value (one inch, for example) reduces the likelihood\nof encountering problems with SCSI driver timeouts and/or\ntimeouts with other devices on the same SCSI bus.\nUnfortunately, it also increases scan times. With current\nSCSI adapters and drivers this option shouldn&rsquo;t be\nneeded any more.\n\nOption\n<b>disable-double-buffering</b> is a global option. If set,\nthe backend will only send one buffer at a time to the\nscanner. Try this option if you have trouble while scanning,\ne.g. SCSI errors, freezes, or the first few cm are repeated\nover and over again in your image.\n\nOption\n<b>disable-backtracking</b> is a positional option. If set,\nthe scanner will not move back its slider after each SCSI\nbuffer is filled (&rsquo;backtracking&rsquo;). Setting this\noption will lead to faster scans but may also produce\nhorizontal stripes. This option doesn&rsquo;t work with\nevery scanner (only some of the paragon models can modify\nbacktracking).\n\nFinally,\n<b>force-wait</b> is a global option. If set, the backend\nwill wait until the device is ready before sending the\ninquiry command. Further more the backend will force the\nscan slider to return to its starting position (not\nimplemented for all scanners). This option may be necessary\nwith the 600 II N or when <a href=\"https://man.page/1/scanimage\">scanimage(1)</a> is used\nmultiple times (e.g. in scripts). The default is off (not\nset).\n\nA sample\nconfiguration file is shown below:\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em\"># limit strip\nheight of all scanners to 1.5 inches: <br>\noption strip-height 1.5 <br>\n/dev/scanner # first Mustek scanner <br>\n# 1 MB buffer for /dev/scanner: <br>\noption buffersize 1024 <br>\n/dev/sge # second Mustek scanner <br>\n# turn on fixes for /dev/sge: <br>\noption lineart-fix <br>\noption linedistance-fix\n\n<h2>SCSI ADAPTER TIPS\n<a name=\"SCSI ADAPTER TIPS\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\nYou need a SCSI\nadapter for the SCSI scanners. Even if the connector is the\nsame as that of parallel port scanners, connecting it to the\ncomputers parallel port will NOT work.\n\nMustek SCSI\nscanners are typically delivered with an ISA SCSI adapter.\nUnfortunately, that adapter is not worth much since it is\nnot interrupt driven. It is (sometimes) possible to get the\nsupplied card to work, but without interrupt line, scanning\nwill be very slow and put so much load on the system, that\nit becomes almost unusable for other tasks.\n\nIf you already\nhave a working SCSI controller in your system, you should\nconsider that Mustek scanners do not support the SCSI-2\ndisconnect/reconnect protocol and hence tie up the SCSI bus\nwhile a scan is in progress. This means that no other SCSI\ndevice on the same bus can be accessed while a scan is in\nprogress.\n\nBecause the\nMustek-supplied adapter is not worth much and because Mustek\nscanners do not support the SCSI-2 disconnect/reconnect\nprotocol, it is recommended to install a separate (cheap)\nSCSI controller for Mustek scanners. For example, ncr810\nbased cards are known to work fine and cost as little as\nfifty US dollars.\n\nFor Mustek\nscanners, it is typically necessary to configure the\nlow-level SCSI driver to disable synchronous transfers (sync\nnegotiation), tagged command queuing, and target\ndisconnects. See <a href=\"https://man.page/5/sane-scsi\">sane-scsi(5)</a> for driver- and\nplatform-specific information.\n\nThe ScanExpress\nmodels have sometimes trouble with high resolution color\nmode. If you encounter sporadic corrupted images (parts\nduplicated or shifted horizontally) kill all other\napplications before scanning and (if sufficient memory is\navailable) disable swapping.\n\nDetails on how\nto get the Mustek SCSI adapters and other cards running can\nbe found at\n<i>http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek-backend/#SCSI</i>.\n\n<h2>PARALLEL PORT SCANNERS\n<a name=\"PARALLEL PORT SCANNERS\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\nThis backend\nhas support for the Paragon 600 II EP and Paragon 600 II N\nparallel port scanners. Note that the latter scanner comes\nwith its own ISA card that implements a funky parallel port\n(in other words, the scanner does not connected to the\nprinter parallel port).\n\nThese scanners\ncan be configured by listing the port number of the adapter\nor the parallel port in the mustek.conf file. Valid port\nnumbers for the 600 II N are <i>0x26b</i>, <i>0x2ab</i>,\n<i>0x2eb</i>, <i>0x22b</i>, <i>0x32b</i>, <i>0x36b</i>,\n<i>0x3ab</i>, <i>0x3eb</i>. For the 600 II EP use one of\nthese: <i>parport0</i>, <i>parport1</i>, <i>parport2</i>,\n<i>0x378</i>, <i>0x278</i>, <i>0x3bc</i>. Pick one that\ndoesn&rsquo;t conflict with the other hardware in your\ncomputer. Put only one number on a single line. Example:\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em\"><i>0x3eb</i>\n\nNote that for\nthese scanners usually root privileges are required to\naccess the I/O ports. Thus, either make frontends such as\n<a href=\"https://man.page/1/scanimage\">scanimage(1)</a> and <a href=\"https://man.page/1/xscanimage\">xscanimage(1)</a> setuid root\n(generally not recommended for safety reasons) or,\nalternatively, access this backend through the network\ndaemon <b>saned</b>(8).\n\nIf the Mustek\nbackend blocks while sending the inquiry command to the\nscanner, add the option <b>force-wait</b> to\n<i>mustek.conf</i>.\n\nAlso note that\nafter a while of no activity, some scanners themselves (not\nthe SANE backend) turns off their CCFL lamps. This shutdown\nis not always perfect with the result that the lamp\nsometimes continues to glow dimly at one end. This\ndoesn&rsquo;t appear to be dangerous since as soon as you\nuse the scanner again, the lamp turns back on to the normal\nhigh brightness. However, the first image scanned after such\na shutdown may have stripes and appear to be over-exposed.\nWhen this happens, just take another scan, and the image\nwill be fine.\n\n<h2>FILES\n<a name=\"FILES\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n<i>/etc/sane.d/mustek.conf</i>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%;\">The backend configuration file\n(see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%;\"><i>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek.a</i>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%;\">The static library implementing\nthis backend.\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%;\"><i>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek.so</i>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%;\">The shared library implementing\nthis backend (present on systems that support dynamic\nloading).\n\n<h2>ENVIRONMENT\n<a name=\"ENVIRONMENT\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n<b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%;\">This environment variable\nspecifies the list of directories that may contain the\nconfiguration file.

Setting the strip-height to a\nsmall value (one inch, for example) reduces the likelihood\nof encountering problems with SCSI driver timeouts and/or\ntimeouts with other devices on the same SCSI bus.\nUnfortunately, it also increases scan times. With current\nSCSI adapters and drivers this option shouldn&rsquo;t be\nneeded any more.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Option\n<b>disable-double-buffering</b> is a global option. If set,\nthe backend will only send one buffer at a time to the\nscanner. Try this option if you have trouble while scanning,\ne.g. SCSI errors, freezes, or the first few cm are repeated\nover and over again in your image.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Option\n<b>disable-backtracking</b> is a positional option. If set,\nthe scanner will not move back its slider after each SCSI\nbuffer is filled (&rsquo;backtracking&rsquo;). Setting this\noption will lead to faster scans but may also produce\nhorizontal stripes. This option doesn&rsquo;t work with\nevery scanner (only some of the paragon models can modify\nbacktracking).</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Finally,\n<b>force-wait</b> is a global option. If set, the backend\nwill wait until the device is ready before sending the\ninquiry command. Further more the backend will force the\nscan slider to return to its starting position (not\nimplemented for all scanners). This option may be necessary\nwith the 600 II N or when <a href=\"https://man.page/1/scanimage\">scanimage(1)</a> is used\nmultiple times (e.g. in scripts). The default is off (not\nset).</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">A sample\nconfiguration file is shown below:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em\"># limit strip\nheight of all scanners to 1.5 inches: <br>\noption strip-height 1.5 <br>\n/dev/scanner # first Mustek scanner <br>\n# 1 MB buffer for /dev/scanner: <br>\noption buffersize 1024 <br>\n/dev/sge # second Mustek scanner <br>\n# turn on fixes for /dev/sge: <br>\noption lineart-fix <br>\noption linedistance-fix</p>\n\n<h2>SCSI ADAPTER TIPS\n<a name=\"SCSI ADAPTER TIPS\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">You need a SCSI\nadapter for the SCSI scanners. Even if the connector is the\nsame as that of parallel port scanners, connecting it to the\ncomputers parallel port will NOT work.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Mustek SCSI\nscanners are typically delivered with an ISA SCSI adapter.\nUnfortunately, that adapter is not worth much since it is\nnot interrupt driven. It is (sometimes) possible to get the\nsupplied card to work, but without interrupt line, scanning\nwill be very slow and put so much load on the system, that\nit becomes almost unusable for other tasks.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">If you already\nhave a working SCSI controller in your system, you should\nconsider that Mustek scanners do not support the SCSI-2\ndisconnect/reconnect protocol and hence tie up the SCSI bus\nwhile a scan is in progress. This means that no other SCSI\ndevice on the same bus can be accessed while a scan is in\nprogress.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Because the\nMustek-supplied adapter is not worth much and because Mustek\nscanners do not support the SCSI-2 disconnect/reconnect\nprotocol, it is recommended to install a separate (cheap)\nSCSI controller for Mustek scanners. For example, ncr810\nbased cards are known to work fine and cost as little as\nfifty US dollars.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">For Mustek\nscanners, it is typically necessary to configure the\nlow-level SCSI driver to disable synchronous transfers (sync\nnegotiation), tagged command queuing, and target\ndisconnects. See <a href=\"https://man.page/5/sane-scsi\">sane-scsi(5)</a> for driver- and\nplatform-specific information.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">The ScanExpress\nmodels have sometimes trouble with high resolution color\nmode. If you encounter sporadic corrupted images (parts\nduplicated or shifted horizontally) kill all other\napplications before scanning and (if sufficient memory is\navailable) disable swapping.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Details on how\nto get the Mustek SCSI adapters and other cards running can\nbe found at\n<i>http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek-backend/#SCSI</i>.</p>\n\n<h2>PARALLEL PORT SCANNERS\n<a name=\"PARALLEL PORT SCANNERS\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">This backend\nhas support for the Paragon 600 II EP and Paragon 600 II N\nparallel port scanners. Note that the latter scanner comes\nwith its own ISA card that implements a funky parallel port\n(in other words, the scanner does not connected to the\nprinter parallel port).</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">These scanners\ncan be configured by listing the port number of the adapter\nor the parallel port in the mustek.conf file. Valid port\nnumbers for the 600 II N are <i>0x26b</i>, <i>0x2ab</i>,\n<i>0x2eb</i>, <i>0x22b</i>, <i>0x32b</i>, <i>0x36b</i>,\n<i>0x3ab</i>, <i>0x3eb</i>. For the 600 II EP use one of\nthese: <i>parport0</i>, <i>parport1</i>, <i>parport2</i>,\n<i>0x378</i>, <i>0x278</i>, <i>0x3bc</i>. Pick one that\ndoesn&rsquo;t conflict with the other hardware in your\ncomputer. Put only one number on a single line. Example:</p>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em\"><i>0x3eb</i></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Note that for\nthese scanners usually root privileges are required to\naccess the I/O ports. Thus, either make frontends such as\n<a href=\"https://man.page/1/scanimage\">scanimage(1)</a> and <a href=\"https://man.page/1/xscanimage\">xscanimage(1)</a> setuid root\n(generally not recommended for safety reasons) or,\nalternatively, access this backend through the network\ndaemon <b>saned</b>(8).</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">If the Mustek\nbackend blocks while sending the inquiry command to the\nscanner, add the option <b>force-wait</b> to\n<i>mustek.conf</i>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\">Also note that\nafter a while of no activity, some scanners themselves (not\nthe SANE backend) turns off their CCFL lamps. This shutdown\nis not always perfect with the result that the lamp\nsometimes continues to glow dimly at one end. This\ndoesn&rsquo;t appear to be dangerous since as soon as you\nuse the scanner again, the lamp turns back on to the normal\nhigh brightness. However, the first image scanned after such\na shutdown may have stripes and appear to be over-exposed.\nWhen this happens, just take another scan, and the image\nwill be fine.</p>\n\n<h2>FILES\n<a name=\"FILES\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\"><i>/etc/sane.d/mustek.conf</i></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%;\">The backend configuration file\n(see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).</p>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%;\"><i>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek.a</i></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%;\">The static library implementing\nthis backend.</p>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%;\"><i>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek.so</i></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%;\">The shared library implementing\nthis backend (present on systems that support dynamic\nloading).</p>\n\n<h2>ENVIRONMENT\n<a name=\"ENVIRONMENT\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em\"><b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:22%;\">This environment variable\nspecifies the list of directories that may contain the\nconfiguration file.
